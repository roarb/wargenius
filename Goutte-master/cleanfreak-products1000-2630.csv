Designed for large carpeted areas, the Pacific Floorcare WAV-26 thoroughly vacuums a 26 inch path in one pass. The WAV-26 has a 24"" brush roll with 2"" of edge cleaning for a total vacuuming path of 26"". It maneuvers easily around obstacles, while the motorized carpet brush helps propel the machine, minimizing operator fatigue. The chevron bristle pattern draws dirt to the vacuum intake for efficient cleaning. With 5 different brush height adjustments, you can set the brush at the perfect height for optimum recovery on any style carpet.<br><br> &#13;
The 1/3 HP brush motor drives the carpet brush at 1200 RPM for effective dirt and debris recovery.  The dual 1.15 HP vacuum motor provides generous pick-up power for thorough cleaning. Both motors are protected from dust by secondary filters, which remove easily for cleaning and inspection. The standard replacement paper bags for the WAV-26 are huge, holding 4 gallons of dry debris, allowing the operator more time for productive cleaning. This large area vacuum <strong>cannot</strong> be used to recover any wet materials. Simple fingertip controls make operation easy for any individual. A built-in hose, wand and on-board tool kit add convenience for off-the-floor cleaning.

This 17"" heavy duty floor sanding buffer has a 1.5"" vacuum port for immediate recovery of dust and debris created during sanding and buffing. The fan cooled motor is totally enclosed, which keeps out dust and dirt for longer motor life. Simply attach one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000093.htm"">backpack vacs</a> or <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">dry tank vacuums</a> to increase productivity by instantly recovering that dust created during those processes. Never before has low speed buffing or sanding been so easy. Other tasks such as scrubbing and stripping are also possible with this machine. With a wet recovery vacuum hooked up, you will recover most of the solution laid down, but you would still need to go over the area with a squeegee to recover 100% of the solution. A vacuum like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001893.htm"">trot mop wet vacuum</a> would be perfect for this follow up recovery step.<br><br>&#13;
The only other model that we have which is similar to this heavy duty floor buffer/sander is the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001058.htm"">Oreck wood floor sanding machine</a>, but it is over twice the price of this unbelievable machine!

· Fully adjustable chrome plated handle makes it easy to operate for any operator.<br>&#13;

The Oreck Low Boy has a powerful induction motor that is totally enclosed. Tiny particles from wood floor sanding will not be able to enter the the motor and wear out the brushes. This ensures that the brushes and commutator will never wear out! When using this machine, it is recommending that you hook up a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">tank vacuum w/ dry pickup</a> to the base of the machine to recover all the particles from sanding a hardwood floor. To attach our sand screens, which are sold separately, you must purchase the pad driver, then attach a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000825.htm"">17 inch white pad</a> to the driver, and then the sand screen to the white pad.<br><br>&#13;
The orbiting transmission runs at over 1725 orbits per minute, which guarantees no gouges or swirls left in your wood floor after you're done sanding. When used as a floor sanding machine, the Low Boy produces such a smooth finish that it actually eliminates steps normally associated with a drum or belt sander. This floor machine has little to no torque, so even for someone who has never operated one before, should have no problem operating it. The 19 inch apron covers the 17 inch pad driver, insuring that all the debris and particles from sanding will be recovered. Also, chemical usage is reduced by up to 50% since it does not throw the chemicals out away from the machine, rather it draws the solution back under the pad where it is needed, in scrubbing or buffing situations.

Once Cam Spray introduced this pressure washing hand cart, we had immediate interest from our local parks department. They were interested in using it a multitude of areas. In the repair shop to clean all their vehicles, to pressure wash trails, and to clean buildings. The hand cart can easily be removed and an attachment for a hitch can be added, so you can either push the cart around, or tow it with a utility vehicle. <strong>The cart is not made for use on public roadways.</strong><br><br>&#13;
This not the most powerful of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000115.htm"">trailer mount pressure washers</a> or of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000114.htm"">pickup mount pressure washers</a>, but it definitely holds it own. The pressure washing hand cart has a powder coated frame, which helps protect the pressure washer and increase its longevity. The pneumatic tires let you effortlessly guide the cart wherever you need to go. A 3000 PSI adjustable pressure pump allows you to clean whatever needs cleaning, and will continuously deliver up to 3.5 gallons of water per minute to rinse the area as well. Comes with a 125 gallon water tank.<br><br>&#13;

The <em>Oreck Orbiter</em> floor machine is versatile enough to do it all. It strips, waxes, buffs, sands and refinishes any floor surface, and also works as a carpet cleaning machine. Whether your floors are marble, vinyl, wood or carpet, the <em>Oreck Orbiter</em> uses a revolutionary oscillating motion that makes it the easiest commercial floor machine to use and maintain in the industry. No torque, no brush marks, no swirls, no sanding marks, no gouges, no big bills from outside contractors, no hanging on for dear life, no belts, no gears, no motor brushes to wear out, no water that can soil and mildew carpets, and best of all - no experience necessary! We recommend this scrubber for small residential and simple commercial jobs, due to its 12 inch cleaning path and 3/4 HP motor.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF"">Take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">floor scrubbing buffers</a> for other options.</font></strong><br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tr>

Apeiron Wet Marble Polishing Powder is used to polish marble, terrazzo and concrete. Some stone like limestone, terrazzo, and concrete may respond to this wet method of polishing, but we cannot guarantee any type of performance improvement on these surfaces. We consider this product to be ""goof proof"" for polishing. In other words, it is extremely easy to use on stone surfaces to bring out a nice shine. This polishing powder comes in a 6.6 pound pail and should be used as outlined in the instructions below.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Scratch Removal Procedures:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. For maximum results the marble should be honed using Apeiron's Scratch Removal Disks. (Time: 30 seconds per sq. ft.).<br>&#13;
2. Completely remove slurry by first wet vacuuming and then either <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/wet-mopping.htm"">mopping the floor</a> or <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/automatic-floor-scrubbing.htm"">automatic scrubbing</a> the floor.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Polishing Procedures:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. Pour 1 ounce of Wet Marble Polishing Powder in a circle onto the dry floor. Pour 4 ounces of water onto the powder.<br>&#13;
2. Using a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000220.htm"">white  buffing pad</a> and one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">175 RPM low speed floor buffers</a>, quickly make one pass over an area of 16-20 sq. ft.<br>&#13;
3. Continue to buff the mixture for 30 seconds per square foot. Keep mixture wet at all times.<br>&#13;
4. Pick up the slurry with a wet vacuum.  Rinse the floor with a neutral cleaner to remove residue.<br><em>(Repeat Application and buffing if higher gloss is desired)</em><br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/apeiron_wet_polish.jpg"" width=""525"" height=""240"" alt=""marble polish be used with a buffer &amp; wet vacuum"" title=""marble polish be used with a buffer &amp; wet vacuum""><br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Professional Tips:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
Most effective when used following the scratch removal process. Because of an initial chemical reaction with the stone, it's important to cover the designated 16-20 sq. ft. area quickly at first. Buff the area consistently, with a slow side-to-side motion. If the area begins to dry, simply add just enough water to keep the area wet. When finished, flood the area and make two passes with machine to break up any dried residue and wet-vacuum the slurry.<br><br>&#13;
For some softer marbles, gloss may be improved by diluting 1 ounce of powder with 6 ounces of water."

Get more bang for your buck! This machine does the work of two machines. Not only does it save you money, but it also saves you from having to transport two machines to each job. Use the lower speed, 180 RPM, to scrub and strip, then just flip the switch to the higher speed, 320 RPM, to polish floors to a glossy luster.

The Trusted Clean Ultimate is a 12 gallon box &#13;
extractor that comes with an external heater for &#13;
extreme cleaning. This heater can be disconnected &#13;
in limited power situations, or if it happens to &#13;
fail, you can still use your extractor as a non-&#13;
heated unit. It is considered to be a state of the &#13;
art extractor because of the leading edge &#13;
technology, with the external heater. The power &#13;
and large capacity combined with a minimum size &#13;
and weight, make this model ideal for the single &#13;
operator. The Ultimate extractor's hi-tech design &#13;
holds a big 12-gallon tank inside a surprisingly &#13;
compact body for maximum efficiency and &#13;
portability, all at a very affordable price! This &#13;
very powerful model delivers the ultimate in both &#13;
pressure and suction, leaving carpets clean and &#13;
virtually dry in record time. Comes complete with &#13;
a deluxe dual-jet stainless steel S-bend wand and &#13;
25-foot hose assembly.<br><br><table width=""560"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""center"" class=""verdanaLinks""><tr>

The Viper Fang 26T automatic floor scrubber keeps the weight of your solution consistently in the center of the machine, between the wheels making it easy to maneuver, even in tight situations. A new anti-foam system prevents foam from reaching the vacuum motor, providing greater reliability and extending vacuum motor life. The Viper auto scrubbers are the only <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/automatic-walk-behind-scrubbers.htm"">automatic walk behind scrubbers</a> to come with an extra set of replacement squeegees, for fast replacement if one tears in the middle of cleaning a floor. A variable pad pressure setting allows you to scrub heavily soiled areas with more pressure to clean deep down. The  Viper Fang 26T also features an easy-fill tank and curved squeegee system.

This 14 inch battery powered floor scrubber is a compact option for scrubbing smaller areas. Works great for office, bathroom, and hallway use. With a 4 gallon solution tank, and a 5 gallon recovery tank, you can consistently scrub for extended periods of time. The battery pack will consistently last for 2 hours of scrubbing on a full charge. We recommend running the machine down until there is no charge left in the battery before recharging, so the unit does not manufacture a memory and lessen your potential run time.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/dumping-compact-scrubber-tank.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""156"" align=""right"" alt=""Dumping your battery powered compact floor scrubber recovery tank"" title=""Dumping your battery powered compact floor scrubber recovery tank"">The nylon scrub brush that comes with the unit, can be used on any hard surface. The follow behind squeegee recovers all the solution, even in the tightest turns. Dumping the recovery tank is easy too! Simply remove the tank and dump it through the recovery hose into a slop sink, toilet, or bucket.<br><br>&#13;
The lowered head design allows the machine to scrub under desks and tables. No more moving heavy furniture to clean all areas of you business! It can also be used around stalls in a bathroom, or in limited areas with lots of obstacles. The greatest part is you never have to worry about dealing with an electrical cord as you scrub, like you do with our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/reliable-electric-scrubber.htm"">electric automatic scrubber</a>.

The Building Service Contractors Association International 1998 Carpet Guide says, ""The pile brush type vacuum will remove deeply embedded soil and open up a nap more than a regular, lightweight vacuum. Usually, a pile brush machine will be used weekly on traffic lanes, monthly on all of the carpeted areas, and always just before any cleaning process. The pile brush vacuum is a dual-purpose machine because it is used both to maintain commercial carpet and to clean.""<br><br>&#13;
Certified® has pioneered and developed the use of the pile brush longer than any other machine manufacturer. Certified® introduced the first two-motor horizontal Pile Brush unit ever manufactured. It is the opinion of thousands of Certified® Pile Brush users, that no cleaning job is complete or professionally done unless prepared by pile brushing. Skillfully engineered and ruggedly built, this is the only unit that offers you these exclusive features.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br><strong>Portable:</strong> The Certified® Pile Brush can be wheeled up a flight of stairs.<br><strong>Operation:</strong> Only the Certified® Pile Brush is self-leveling and depth of brushing varies on the same rug conditions and height of pile.<br><strong>Transmission:</strong> Brush drive is positive and geared to motor to insure continuous brush action even when pile is high or badly matted.<br><strong>Motor:</strong> Out in the open away from dust and grit means longer life.<br><strong>Vacuum System:</strong> The exclusive sand trap prevents bobby pins, paper clips, carpet tacks or other metallic objects from ruining vacuum fan blades. Only lint and dust reach the blades and refill the disposable bag.<br><strong>Brush:</strong> The Vegetable Fiber brush has gentle grooming action - does not break, cut or pull pile loop. Does not mat and is self-cleaning. Only Certified® permits reversing of brush for longer wear.

The Tornado BR 16/3 cylindrical brush floor scrubber lays down solution, scrubs and recovers in either direction. The BR 16/3 is great for cleaning and maintaining virtually any hard floor surface, including tile in bathrooms and impression areas. Height adjustable transport wheels permit variable pressure, which is really great for scrubbing grout. A convenient foot switch lowers and raises the squeegees while simultaneously starting and stopping the vac motor. This Tornado grout scrubber comes standard with soft brushes but you can add firm, or grit brushes, which are excellent for grouted areas. Confined areas are also no problem for the unit. Take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000038.htm"">grout scrubbing machines</a> for more options.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;
· Takes automatic scrubbing into confined areas where bigger units can't go.<br>&#13;
· Removable water tanks are easily emptied, rinsed, and re-filled.<br>&#13;

For larger finish jobs, the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000218.htm"">floor finish flat wax applicator mops</a> provide performance, while being economic. This white, non-linting, continuous filament looped-end mop is constructed of pure nylon, which provides smooth gliding, releasing quickly and completely. Improves operator productivity by 50% versus traditional finish mops. The floor finish flat mops effectively apply thinner coats, giving you a faster drying time, and less wasted finish. The looped finish mop virtually eliminates fraying and untwisting while extending the life of the mop. The keyhole round construction allows the mop to slide onto the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001102.htm"">24"" mop frame</a>, giving it a snug fit when snapped on. Laundering is not required, simply rinse in cool clean water for 2 minutes or more and then drip dry.<br><br>&#13;
We have found the easiest way to apply <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000009.htm"">floor wax</a> with this flat mop is to use a pattern similar to agriculture crop harvesting, where one row is done at a time. Outline or 'edge' the floor on three sides. Once this is accomplished, work the finish mop from one side of the floor to the other, until you reach the end of wall where you started. To insure even coverage, overlap the edge of the mop where finish has already been applied.

The <em>CleanFreak</em> 1500 RPM fixed handle burnisher is powered by a 1.5 HP A.C. motor with twin capacitors. The A.C. style motor is rated to run up to five times longer than normal D.C. powered burnishers.  Because of the A.C. motor, the machine will never try and overwork itself, and will actually start to cut out if you put too much of a load on the head. To help extend the life of the motor, when the machine starts to draw too many amps, it will actually cut out until you take some pressure off of the head and allow the amp draw to return to normal. The head of this machine was designed to just float over floors and polish. The bent handle allows for you to effortlessly guide the burnisher over your floor for a maximum shine to your finish. <strong>No additional pressure need be applied!</strong> Just guide the burnisher as it polishes, do not push the head into the floor!<br><br><table width=""560"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""center"" class=""verdanaLinks""><tr>

                                  The beauty in this machine is its simplicity! Compared to a lot of our other <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/automatic-walk-behind-scrubbers.htm"">automatic walk behind scrubbers</a>, the <em>CleanFreak</em> ""Performer 20"" auto scrubber has fewer gizmos and gadgets, which equals fewer repairs and headaches down the road. A simple control panel features, a brush on/off button, a vacuum on/off button, a full recovery tank light, and an empty solution tank light. When the empty solution tank light comes on, there will be enough solution left for a full 2 minutes of scrubbing.<br><br>&#13;
                                  The drive for the machine is brush/pad driver assisted and operated with a lever on the handle. <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000219.htm"">Scrub pads</a> and/or <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000163.htm"">brushes</a> need to be purchased separately depending on the type of flooring you need to clean. When the handle is released the machine continues to scrub and vacuum for a few seconds to recover all solution left on the floor. The solution control lever is located on the rear of the machine and must be closed completely when you are not operating the machine. <strong>*Note:</strong> The gravity fed solution control will continue to dispense solution, even when turned off, if the control valve is not closed completely.<br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

The adjustable pump Extreme extractor by Trusted &#13;
Clean works great for any type of situation where &#13;
you need to control the flow, and amount of water &#13;
you are putting down onto your surface. This is &#13;
why it is the preferred choice for upholstery and &#13;
and auto detailing, because you can turn the pump &#13;
pressure way down, limiting how much water you &#13;
dump into the upholstery. This helps in the drying &#13;
process, so it dries quickly and efficiently. &#13;
Speed up your drying times, by using one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000076.htm&#13;%0A"">carpet blowing fans</a>.<br><br><hr size=""1"">

This model, and the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001037.htm"">Panasonic Ultra Pro vacuum</a> are two of the  most powerful <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000179.htm"">single motor upright vacuums</a> on the market. Both of these two models come with a  10 amp commercial motor. The major difference is this model comes with OptiFlow technology, meaning that in traditional bag compartments, air flow is restricted as the bag fills with dirt. Panasonic's new OptiFlow double wall bag chamber allows that previously restricted air to flow freely, keeping vacuum performance consistent until the bag is ready to be replaced.<br><br>&#13;
The hard body, commercial motor, replaceable brushes, and motor protection system, make this vacuum the preferred vacuum of all commercial contract cleaning professionals. With a HEPA filtration, you can be sure not only are you recovering as much dirt as possible, but you can also feel perfectly safe that you are releasing as little dirt back into the air as possible through the exhaust.<br><br><strong><u><font color=""#0000FF"">Specifications:</font></u></strong><br>&#13;

This <em>CleanFreak</em> heated carpet extractor has been slightly used. It has been thoroughly inspected by our qualified technicians and has passed all quality assurance tests. You <b>save over $100.00</b> off of the normal sale price on this unit, and it is nearly new. Make sure to snatch up this great deal before it passes you by!<br><br>&#13;
This unit uses hot water and an adjustable glide wand to remove as much dirt from your carpets as mechanically possible. The hot water severs the bond between the dirt and the carpet fibers, allowing it to be recovered by the drag wand. The single jet wand has an adjustable glide that consistently recovers 30% more solution on each pass than traditional <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000231.htm"">drag wands</a>. For more information on how the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002308.htm"">adjustable glide drag wand</a> is able to accomplish what it does, please take a look at its individual product page.<br><br><hr size=""1"">

The dual 1000 watt heaters will provide a maximum water temperature of 210° F. Between the heater, pump, and vacuum, you'll need to power the unit with electrical outlets on 2 separate circuit breakers. The machine itself has a built in circuit locator that will tell you if you're on 2 separate circuits or not. Simply press the circuit locator button when plugged into 2 separate outlets, and if the light turns on, you know you're good to start extracting. If not, you'll need to search for another outlet. <strong>*Note:</strong> Do not use extension cords with this machine unless they are a heavier gauge than the ones attached to the unit.<br><br><hr size=""1"">

Your carpet extractor should be winterized between uses if it is to be exposed to freezing temperatures. To winterize your machine, pour 1/2 gallon of windshield wiper fluid into the empty solution tank. Run the pump until fluid flows through the tank. Then run 1 gallon of water through the extractor before the next use."

<br>&#13;
The decision was never easier. Trusted Clean's commitment to airflow efficiency has culminated in the 6 qt. backpack. All vacuums test to their optimum performance when new. The true test of performance comes as debris fills the vacuum bag. In older tubular backpack designs, the bag bulges and stretches when it fills, contacting the side wall and top of the motor, severely reducing the airflow. The new 6 qt. backpack has 3/4"" per side increase in diameter and a new bag support increases air flow and reduces motor heat, allowing an increase in motor warranty to 5 years! Trusted Clean clearly takes the technological edge in vacuum design and efficiency!<br><br><strong>View our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000093.htm"">backpack &amp; shoulder strap vacs</a>, for more options.</strong><br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><u><strong>Advantages over the competition:</strong></u></font><br>&#13;
· A deflector plate holds the heavy debris away from the motor filter during use, increasing air flow, and decreasing motor heat.<br>&#13;
· The tapered vacuum body gives an extra ¾"" per side to allow air to flow around a bulging bag that is full of debris.<br>&#13;
· 70"" of sound deadening waffle foam make it the quietest vacuum in its category.<br>&#13;
· Lifetime warranty on the body, with 5 years on the motor, and 1 year on parts.&#13;

<p>The SGP-Mini is a minnow-sized pressure washer with the bite of a Shark. Few, &#13;
  if any, other hot water pressure washers in the market are so compact and rugged. &#13;
  Thanks to revolutionary Shark engineering, the SGP-Mini is capable of operating &#13;
  the burner off the engine so there is no need for a battery. While weighing &#13;
  in at just over 300 lbs., it is still packed with many of the high-grade components &#13;
  that have made the SGP the most popular hot water pressure washer in the Shark &#13;
  line. For instance, the SGP-Mini is protected by a rugged steel, single piece, &#13;
  roll cage and is easy to maneuver with its four oversized, 13-inch tubed pneumatic &#13;
  tires. It also features an industrial-grade Legacy Pump, a water-resistant control &#13;
  panel with adjustable thermostat and hour meter, a high efficiency 12V DC Beckett &#13;
  burner, and a leak-free, cold-rolled hot water coil made of half-inch Schedule &#13;

Designed from the ground-up by Tornado engineers, the Windshear 3000 blower/dryer combines innovation, rugged construction, and common-sense design in an economic package. The Windshear is the answer for drying carpets, upholstery, or hard floors. This go-anywhere unit is a durable, rotationally molded dryer with sensible features and unmatched professional performance.<br><br>&#13;
The Tornado Windshear is perfect for use after fire, flood, or other water damage as well as for drying wet floors during rainy or snowy seasons. It is also appropriate for general air circulation in almost any facility. The motor is mounted at four points instead of a typical three-point mounting. This design serves to reduce noise and vibration as well as increase the machine's life. A three-speed switch permits airflow selection of 1600, 2000, and 2500 CFM. Airflow may be directed at three angles (0, 30, and 90-degree), and the units are stackable for easy storage. Carry handle and cord wrap is molded in for easy transport.<br><br>&#13;

This ECS scrubber is the big brother to the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000736.htm"">20"" Green Eco-Friendly auto scrubber</a>. They both do a nice job when time is of the essence, but this 28"" model really extends your scrubbing time. With an average usage rate of 1.9 gallons per hour, a full tank would give you over 10 hours of continuous scrubbing. This nearly 3 times as long as the machine will run on a full charge. With the ""Chem Dose System,"" which we throw in for free, you can just leave your chemical and clean water in the solution tank until the next time you need to scrub. We always recommend emptying and cleaning out the recovery tank after each and every cleaning.<br><br>&#13;
A <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/walk-behind-sweepers.htm"">walk behind sweeper</a> is an absolute must wherever this machine is used, unless your floors are already extremely clean and dust free. With the limited water release, the clean water dirties rather quickly, and any dust or dirt we can remove beforehand will only assist in the ability of this auto scrubber to clean.

Our most popular grit stripping brush, which comes with a bristle length of 1.75"". An aggressive brush for general scrubbing or stripping finishes from hard surfaces, including terrazzo and tile floors.

Not only can this brush strip a tiled floor, but it can also effectively clean wide grout lines. It is a nylon bristled brush with the bristles impregnated with an 80 grit silicon carbide abrasive for extra scrubbing power. Each grit brush offers solutions to a wide range of heavy duty cleaning situations.

A hospital-grade, hard water, serum-effective quaternary germicidal detergent incorporating a unique non-alkaline detergent system blended with four quat chains. Because of its acidic base, it is very effective in cutting alkaline build-ups such as soap scum and hard water deposits. It is also milder to the skin and less damaging to floors because of the low pH. USDA C1 approved. For other specialized disinfectants, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002025.htm"">exercise equipment disinfecting wipes</a> and <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000248.htm"">k-9 parvo disinfectant</a>, take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000055.htm"">disinfectant cleaners</a> and <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000249.htm"">wipes</a>.<br><br><font color=""0000FF""><strong><u>Applications:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;
A one-product system of sanitation. Maxima may be used as a glass cleaner, bowl cleaner, bright work cleaner, cleanser, lime and soap scum remover. It may be used on floors, walls, painted surfaces, and all washable, hard, non-porous surfaces. One product, at one dilution rate makes it easier to train personnel, less to order, less to inventory. Using Maxima gives you the confidence that every hospital grade surface you've cleaned is also disinfected and deodorized."

For a more heavy duty model, which is even better at recovering ultra fine powders, and heavy oils, take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001405.htm"">sand, oil, &amp; metal shavings recovery vacuum</a>.<br><br>&#13;

Many competitive vacuum systems use waterlift as the primary measure of effectiveness and power. In a heavy industrial application, however, such vacuums may lack sufficient airflow (cubic feet per minute, or CFM) to meet requirements. A unit's CFM tells the true story of its capability in bulk recovery environments. With high-levels of airflow, like the 340 CFM on this model with a 3"" orifice, our jumbo wet/dry vacuums with external filters are ideal for rapid, efficient high-volume debris recovery.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Specifications:</u></font></strong><br><strong>Powerheads:</strong> Two 2.25 Vacuum Motors<br><strong>Static Waterlift:</strong> 51""<br><strong>Air Movement:</strong> 243 CFM (2"" orifice) / 340 CFM (3"" orifice)<br><strong>Poly External Filters:</strong> Two<br><strong>Filter Area:</strong> 3748 square inches<br><strong>Effective Horizontal Reach:</strong> 50'"

With exceptional ease of use, the operator friendly Aztec Liquidator minimizes lay down time and ensures even, thorough solution coverage. When filled with water and the chemical appropriate for your job, this unit can apply up to 50,000 square feet of solution per hour. The 36 gallon solution tank is the largest applicator we have available in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000202.htm"">floor stripping equipment</a> section. You can dispense <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000010.htm"">stripping solutions</a> with this machine, but the <strong>Liquidator needs to be thoroughly rinsed out after each use.</strong> Our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001546.htm"">super concentrated floor wax stripper</a> works perfect with this machine, because the stripping solution is mixed with water. It comes packaged as 6 quarts, which makes approximately 30 gallons of stripper.<br><br>&#13;
The left valve control lever on the handle will dispense a 26"" path of solution in front of the machine. The right valve control lever will dispense an additional 26"" path from the manifold on the right. The right arm is spring loaded, so it will spring back to accommodate narrow areas. If the Liquidator is not laying down an even solution across the floor, the tank may need to be filled, or the spreader bar may have a tear in it and needs to be replaced.<br><br>&#13;
For complete step by step stripping instructions, please take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">floor stripping procedures</a> guide.

This jumbo vacuum comes on a 55 gallon drum and cart for easy movement around the shop or industrial manufacturing plant. The single external filter can recover both wet &amp; dry materials without having to switch filters. This eliminates the need for your employees to choose the correct filter depending on the matter they are recovering. Never again will you ruin a filter, or even worse, a vacuum by recovering a liquid with a solids filter.<br><br>&#13;
The Tornado wet &amp; dry recovery single external filter vacuum is powered by compressed air, but we do have other models available, including electric powered vacuums in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000188.htm"">jumbo industrial external filter vacuums</a> category.  These vacuum create waterlift substantially beyond that found in traditional <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">wet recovery vacuums with dry pick-up</a>. These jumbo units are designed for industrial applications requiring extremely aggressive pick-up power. These machines' roles are primarily for rapid high-volume recovery of wet and dry debris.<br><br><table width=""575"" border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

This metal scraps, grindings, and chips recovery vacuum is powered by compressed air. We recommend running a minimum of a 25 HP air compressor that can maintain 30 to 60 PSI for light dtuy recovery, and 60 to 90 PSI for heavy duty recovery. Heavy duty recovery would include things like liquid, oil, and sludge. Very often in metal manufacturing plants, you get a mixture of steel and water or oil, so this vacuum would be able to recover all those solutions without a problem! This vacuum is also powered by an air compressor, meaning there are no moving parts, so nothing can fail over time.<br><br>&#13;
If this metal recovery vacuum by Tornado is not exactly what you're looking for, please take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000188.htm"">external filter jumbo industrial vacuums</a>.<br><br><table width=""575"" border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

Take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/burnishing-a-floor.htm"">floor burnishing procedures</a> for more tips and hints on how to effectively polish your floor.<br><br><strong>*Please Note:</strong> Due to the amount of power that this machine pulls, you may need to run it on a dedicated 20 amp circuit. We recommend using a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001259.htm"">20 inch horse hair burnishing pad</a>, along with our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000274.htm"">mop on floor restorer</a> to achieve the optimum shine with this high speed floor polisher. We don't recommend spray buffing or using soft pads with this machine. These items tend to increase drag, putting more stress on the motor, increasing the potential for the burnisher to blow electrical breakers.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;

Use this fabulous floor stripper to remove floor waxes; acrylic, styrene, polymers, co-polymers, oligimers, and metal crosslinked finishes. It can also be used to remove acrylic and water based urethane sealers.  For other finishes, take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000010.htm"">floor finish removing strippers</a>.<br><br>&#13;
Before using this powerful stripping solution across your entire floor, you should pre-test on a small area. <strong>Warning: Do not use this stripper undiluted.</strong> Dilute 1 part stripper to 20 parts water using hot water (1 quart of this stripper would be mixed with 5 gallons of warm/hot water). Mop this solution onto your floor and allow to set for 3 or 4 minutes. Do not allow stripper to dry on floor, reapply if necessary. Use one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">rotary floor buffers</a> &amp; a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000105.htm"">stripping pad</a> to agitate and loosen your finish. Picking up the loosened finish is usually most effective with a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">wet pickup tank vacuum</a>, especially one with a front mount squeegee, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002588.htm"">Trusted Clean Quench 18</a>. Rinse surface thoroughly with clean water, to ensure the removal of all stripping solution and old wax. Use a neutralizer to remove remaining residue after rinsing. Apply finish in normal manner. For more in depth instructions, take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">floor stripping guide</a>.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Attention:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;
Read all cautions and directions before using this product. It contains alkaline ingredients normally found in powerful strippers. Quick penetrating agents and liquefying ingredients require that this product be used according to directions.<br><br>&#13;
On old linoleum, rubber and asphalt floors do not use an over concentration of solution or bleaching or discoloring may occur. Test a small area using a solution no stronger than 1 part of stripper to 10 parts of water. Adjust concentration to strip effectively without harming floor substrate.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

The EDIC Pilot is the most compact portable floor and grout auto scrubber on the market. It is just right for small to medium sized areas, like bathrooms, or office settings. The Pilot is the economic and effective way to clean hard floors from the deepest periodic grout cleaning to daily floor maintenance scrubbing. The clean solution is kept in a container on the handle, and the recovered solution is kept in an easy to remove see-through tank. The tank is easily observable to empty when full, and it contains the dirty solution, instead of spreading it over different parts of the floor. It is great for cleaning grouted floors and textured ceramic tiles, due to it's unique split level angled brushes and squeegee. Take a look at our other <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000038.htm"">grout scrubbers</a> for more options.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
· Portable auto scrubber excels in cleaning small areas like bathrooms.<br>&#13;
· High speed counter rotating brushes deep clean grouted surfaces very quickly.<br>&#13;
· Squeegee recovery system is located directly behind the brushes, so the dispensed solution is recovered immediately after the floor is scrubbed, leaving that surface completely dry.<br>&#13;
· 1 year warranty covers labor and manufacturer defects on parts.<br><br><table class=""verdanaLinks"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""100%"">

Most competitive <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000034.htm"">carpet cleaning stain removers</a> contain ingredients that require the carpet to be rinsed or extracted after spot or stain removal.  If they are not rinsed the residue will immediately begin to attract soil. The Trusted Clean Encapsulation Spotter should not be rinsed so that the encapsulation of the spot residue can be vacuumed away and the soil repelling properties will continue to work. This product is effective on both water and petroleum based spots and spills.<br><br>&#13;
Our Safeguard carpet care products do not contain any optical brightener. Most carpet manufactures object to their use because they can distort the carpet color even after one use. Safeguard products are also formulated in a pH range so they will meet all carpet manufacturers recommendations for ""Wet Side"" cleaning. They are also safe for use on traditional wool carpeting and for upholstery shampooing on all fabrics not harmed by water.*<br><br>&#13;
*As with all cleaning products, always check for colorfastness on carpeting and upholstery in an inconspicuous area before using these products.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;

scrubs your carpeting, and recovers that solution, &#13;
all in one pass. Never has it been so simple to &#13;
clean your carpets! The dirty solution is emptied &#13;
from the Marathon 800 by a dump hose located at &#13;
the rear of the machine. The recovery tank has a &#13;
clear plastic lid to see when you rank is getting &#13;
near full. Always make sure to empty the recovery &#13;
tank before it is full, because vacuum motor &#13;
failure from over-filling is not covered under the &#13;
warranty. This goes for all of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000074.htm&#13;%0A"">self-contained carpet scrubbing extractors</a>.&#13;
<br><br>&#13;
This electric powered unit utilizes a unique &#13;
internal bladder design that maintains optimal &#13;
brush pressure throughout operation regardless of &#13;
solution level. This bladder design requires less &#13;
space and allows sleeker exterior with improved &#13;
sight lines for you, the operator. Whether used in &#13;
an office, classroom, hallway, lobby, or even your &#13;
own home, the Marathon 800 leaves behind clean &#13;
carpets. The unit was designed with you in mind, &#13;
making it the easiest to use model on the market!&#13;

scrubs and cleans carpeting in both forward and &#13;
reverse! This model is also available in a 7 and &#13;
12 gallon unit, please call for special pricing if &#13;

two-way system provides unparalleled productivity &#13;
in any setting, cleaning up to 4,000 square feet &#13;

clean corners and other tight areas for a dramatic &#13;
reduction in labor costs. When this happens, the &#13;
recovery shoes switch, and the brushes spin in the &#13;
opposite direction for ease of use.<br><br>&#13;

areas, like hallways and hotel ballrooms. It is a &#13;

This truck mount steam brush cleans twice as fast as the typical wand method. It quickly breaks down dirt, and penetrates deep down to the base of the carpet fibers. So, not only does it speed up your cleaning, but it also does a better job by giving the carpet fibers a deep scrub. This model can handle temperatures up to 200° F, and pressure up to 400 PSI, allowing it to be used with any standard box extractor or truck mount carpet cleaning machine.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

This vacuum is powered by 1145 Watts of combined maximum vacuum power thanks to its dual motor system.  Two motors enable the Sandia Force 14 to recover ground-in dust and dirt more effectively than the competition. One 145 watt motor is designed to drive the brush roll, which agitates the carpet fibers, breaking the bonds between the dirt and the carpet. A second 1000 watt twin fan motor powers the vacuum motor to maximize productivity, even when the bag is near full. <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000179.htm"">Dual motor vacuum cleaners</a> have more power than the typical <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000086.htm"">single motor uprights</a>, because they have two separate motors powering the vacuum and the brush, which in turn removes more deeply embedded dirt and debris.<br><br>&#13;
When the Force's handle is in the upright position at startup or when vacuum tools are being used, the roller brush motor automatically turns off to protect the carpet. A clean air motor system also eliminates motor and fan damage because the airflow system bypasses the fan and delivers dirt and debris directly into the top-filling bag. An electronic sensor notifies you as to when the brush/hose is clogged, or when a belt breaks.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

We recommend that this brush be used with our 13"" <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">rotary buffers</a> that have at least a 1/2 HP motor. The absolute perfect machine is our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001683.htm"">13 inch carpet scrubbing floor buffer</a>, which actually has a 3/4 HP motor, to guarantee it will power through the most adverse carpeting conditions.  The outer white rows break the soil free, while the inner rows gently massage the carpet fibers.<br><br>&#13;
It is a good idea to break this brush in before using it on carpeting. A great way to do this is to run the brush for about 10 minutes on a concrete surface. This will remove any potential burrs that may have been created during the manufacturing process.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/13-inch-carpet-brush-clutch-plate.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""135"" align=""right"" style=""margin: 0 0 0 10px"" alt=""13 inch carpet scrubbing brush with clutch plate"" title=""13 inch carpet scrubbing brush with clutch plate"">This 13"" carpet brush does not have a glide, nor showerfeed holes.

Our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000226.htm"">carpet drying dehumidifiers</a> help to reduce the humidity in enclosed structural environments by removing water vapor from the air.  With proper use, dehumidifiers can help dry wet materials like carpets, carpets pads, floors, walls, building contents, and more. Using Dri-Eaz portable dehumidifiers may also prevent secondary damage caused by high humidity. Comes with a built-in air duct ring for easy attachment to expandable ducting. Depending on current electrical rates, machine can be run for a 24 hour period, and use approximately $1.50 worth of electricity for that entire 24 hour period.<br><br>&#13;
You should operate your Dri-Eaz portable dehumidifier in an enclosed area, as this creates a drying chamber. Close all doors, windows or areas that open to the outside to maximize the unit's water removal efficiency. Keep all traffic through the drying chamber to a minimum. Place the unit in the middle of the room, away from walls and doors.<br><br>&#13;
If you transport a dehumidifier in a horizontal position, set it upright for at least 30 minutes before you turn it on. This is necessary because when the machine is horizontal, the oil from the compressor flows into the refrigerant coils reducing the ability of the dehumidifier to function.<br><br><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""100%"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

The Mark Series machines incorporate the new technology of pressurized wet steam at temperatures between 240F to 330F to thermally breakdown grease and bacteria to sanitize without chemicals. Traditionally, this has been achieved through the use of high cost chemicals and intensive manual cleaning which can further contaminate the food product. The Sanitech system eliminates the usage of chemicals, soaps, and detergents and, is portable and compact enough to be handled by a single employee. Chemical free cleaning prolongs the durability of kitchen equipment, tiles and grouting. The water requirements of a Sanitech are lower than that of a pressure washer, thereby conserving water and saving the environment from chemical effluents in the sewage.<br><br>&#13;
Sanitech machines are USDA compliant for indoor usage as they run on environmentally friendly LPG, which is a clean burning fuel. Using Sanitech equipment gives you close to zero bacteria counts, saves money spent on cleaning crews and chemicals, reduces wear and tear on equipment through a single step sanitation process. Food service establishments can reduce up to 50% of the labor hours spent on cleaning which improves employee morale and efficiency. Higher levels of sanitation achieved by using a Sanitech prevent slip and fall accidents and thereby indirectly reduce insurance premiums.<br><br><u><font color=""#0000FF""><strong>Safe for Use on:</strong></font></u><br>&#13;

The Stainless Steel Mark III is our most popular <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000229.htm"">vapor steam cleaner</a> for food processors. The heavy duty construction includes stainless steel heat coils. The Mark III is our most powerful model that only requires an electrical supply of 115 volts. This makes it very easy to move throughout your facility to where your sanitation needs require it. Unit comes with electronic pilot controlled ignition, 50' steam/pressure hose, 36"" gun w/ trigger control, adjustable temperature control, 3 nozzles, stainless steel coils, automatic thermal relief, automatic pressure relief, and automatic flow control. The 30 to 40 pound propane tank is sold separately, and will typically power this unit for 3 to 4 hours of consistent use.

The Sanitech Mark III is a sanitation system, which was developed to give your sanitation crew a tool to increase their speed and efficiency in performing their daily sanitation tasks. The Mark III's effectiveness on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"" target=""_blank"">Listeria</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"" target=""_blank"">E. coli</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"" target=""_blank"">Salmonella</a> and other pathogens make them ideal for processing facilities where cross contamination is such a concern. Manual methods of sanitation using a combination of hot water from the boiler, chemicals, sanitizers and manual labor are both slow and prone to inconsistencies. This model conforms to USDA &amp; EPA indoor standards.<br><br>&#13;
The Mark III can reach up to 330°, but at 310° the machine is pumping out pure steam.  For the most effective cleaning, we recommend dialing down the steam to about 260-270°, this will give you the correct amount of steam, with water pressure, to be the most effective in removing heavy stains and grime, as well as sanitizing areas.  The Mark III's pump requires that the oil be changed periodically for maximum effectiveness.<br><br><u><font color=""#0000FF""><strong>Industry Users:</strong></font></u><br>&#13;

"Commercial Steam Cleaner for Allergies",VIN-VC4000,"VC4000 Commercial Vapor Steam Cleaning System<br><em>(Achieves 275° F tank temperature!)</em><br><strong>Regular Price: $1289.00<br><font color=""#FF0000"">Sale Price: $1095.00</font></strong><br><br>&#13;
The VC 4000 vapor steam cleaner is a continuous flow steam cleaner. That means there is no down time for refilling the 2 quart heating tank, because of the 4 quart refill tank. The unit does not actually have a hose hook-up for continuous filling, but in fact the 4 quart refill tank continually fills the boiler tank as you clean. With the heating element, and the 85 PSI pump, this unit pulls 15 amps, and will work on a typical 100 Volt household outlet, for about 2 hours of non-stop cleaning. For other units with more options, take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000229.htm"">commercial steam vapor cleaners</a>.<br><br>&#13;
With this unit, you get a full complement of attachments and accessories, which are pictured below. These attachments are good for cleaning grout, windows, mirrors, and fine detailing on countertops and grout lines. Also great for cleaning greasy kitchen appliances, pet stains, and removing gum from carpeting. Go Green, use steam! These steam cleaners are Green rated, due to the fact that they use no chemicals, only water. <br><br>&#13;
A must have cleaner for any individual with allergies. The VC 4000 sanitizes and removes dirt, stains, mold, germs, spores, bacteria, and kills dust mites from all surfaces. Dust mites are microscopic, and can not be seen by the human eye. Cleaning your mattress and couches with any good vapor steam cleaning system will kill the dust mites instantly. People are not actually allergic to the dust mites themselves, it is their shedded skin and feces that cause the allergic reactions. Asthma suffers beware, the VC4000 commercial steam cleaner may change your life!

Products HydraPort 200 is a heated portable carpet &#13;
extractor with a 50 - 200 PSI adjustable pump. It &#13;
is typically utilized for exceptional carpet &#13;
cleaning and upholstery detailing. Check out our &#13;
<a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/resourc&#13;%0Ae_center.htm"">resource center</a> for directions &#13;
on <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/carpet-&#13;%0Acleaning-extraction.htm"">how to properly extract &#13;
soil from carpeting</a>. With the HydraPort, &#13;
you'll be working with a high-production &#13;
upholstery and carpet cleaner which is ideal for &#13;
institutional use, or multi-family carpet &#13;
cleaning.<br><br>&#13;
With the 3 stage vacuum motor and 1750 watt heater &#13;
the Hydraport 200 needs 2 power cords because of &#13;
all the electric amps it pulls. The 3 stage vacuum &#13;
motor gives the machine 140"" of water lift, &#13;
leaving your customers' carpets dry after a few &#13;
hours, depending on external circumstances. We &#13;
recommend purchasing a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000076.htm&#13;%0A"">high powered carpet fan</a> for decreasing the &#13;
amount of drying time needed.<br><br>&#13;

HydraPort carpet extractor rear view"">The U.S. &#13;
Products HyraPort 400 is a heated extractor with &#13;
an adjustable PSI pump, which ranges from 50-400 &#13;
PSI. The 1750 watt in-line heater will provide &#13;
instant heat, up to 212° F, and comes with a &#13;
lifetime warranty. The 400 PSI displacement pump &#13;
is great for deep restorative carpet cleaning, or &#13;
it can also be dialed down for upholstery &#13;
cleaning. The HydraPort line was designed to &#13;
handle the toughest commercial and residential &#13;
jobs. This unit comes complete with a 15 foot &#13;
solution/vacuum hose, and a 12"" drag wand. &#13;
Upholstery tools &amp; solutions are sold separately. &#13;

We always recommend using the proper dilution of &#13;
your <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/carpet-&#13;%0Acleaning-chemicals.htm"">carpet cleaning &#13;
chemicals</a>. Over mixing can result in soap, or &#13;
shampoo, left over in the carpeting which attracts &#13;
dirt quickly. So shortly after cleaning, it will &#13;
appear that your carpeting is even dirtier than &#13;
before you cleaned. Another problem that can occur &#13;
is excess foam build up, which can bypass built-in &#13;
safety measures and ruin a vacuum motor. We always &#13;
recommend using a defoaming product, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000886.htm&#13;%0A"">concentrated liquid defoamer</a> to help prevent &#13;
this as much as possible. For complete step-by-&#13;

"Continuous Fill Steam Cleaning Machine",EST-ES-6100,"EuroSteam ES 6100 Continuous Fill Steam Cleaning Machine<br><em>(Achieves 330° F tank temperature!)</em><br><b>Regular Price $2825.00<br><font color=""#FF0000"">Sale Price: $2425.00</font></b><br><br>&#13;
The Eurosteam ES 6100 comes either with continuous fill capabilities, or a chemical/disinfectant tank. It has a 3 liter boiler, and a 5 liter holding tank. The boiler is made from two pieces of stainless steel that surgically welded together, to withstand up to 10,000 PSI. The entire unit, including the outer shell is made out of stainless steel. The 4"" soft rubber transport wheels make it very easy to transport. They can  also be locked for safety when spraying on inclined surfaces. Take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000229.htm"">vapor steam cleaners</a> for other options.<br><br>&#13;
On the ES 6100, the high to low steam settings are controlled by a knob, giving you complete control of the output temperature of your steam. You can clean surfaces at temperatures between 185° F &amp; 245° F, for hours at a time with our continuous fill option. The ES 6100 is commercially rated model, that was created for the customer who needs to clean everyday, all day without stopping. Take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001770.htm"">EuroSteam steam cleaning cart</a> for something smaller, but with a traveling janitorial cart.<br><br>&#13;
The continuous fill capability of this machine may be a little confusing. The steam cleaner actually does not have a hose hook-up on the unit, it actually has a 5 liter holding tank which continuously fills the boiler as you're cleaning. This 8 liters of solution can have you cleaning for up to 2.5 hours on a single tank full.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;

The Powr-Flite Comfort Pro backpack vacuum is a 4 stage HEPA filtered backpack vacuum, but only when used with the HEPA filtered vac bags. This model is the perfect vacuum for cleaning inside hospitals, grocery stores, and wherever indoor air quality (IAQ) is a concern. With the standard true HEPA filtration system, it will filter down debris to 0.3 microns. The CRI (<a href=""http://www.carpet-rug.org/commercial-customers/cleaning-and-maintenance/seal-of-approval-products/vacuums.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Carpet &amp; Rug Institute</a>) has certified this vacuum with a gold rating, meaning it excels in soil removal, dust containment, and surface appearance change. The 6 quart bag capacity, and its lightweight body, make the Comfort Pro one of the most <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000093.htm"">compact backpack HEPA vacs</a> we have to offer.<br><br>&#13;
Weighing less than 12 lbs, this model was designed with the user in mind! An ergonomically padded waist and shoulder harness (designed by Deuters, an industry leader in backpack and hiking gear) eliminates body fatigue, while the compact body design allows the user to easily clean in normally hard to reach places. The Comfort Pro backpack vac comes with a heavy duty tool kit, 4' hose, is ""Gold"" certified by the CRI, and best of all, is affordable!<br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

The following testimonials, were taken directly from the Motsenbocker website;<br><br>&#13;
- ""My brotherinlaw, Joe, loves to have a glass of red wine with his dinner, but always manages to spill some or all of it on my white tablecloths. I cant tell you how many tablecloths Ive had to throw away as well as socalled stain removers. Well, I was almost ready to throw Joe away, when I found Lift Off #1. What a joy!! It removes the red wine stains completely! Thank you, Lift Off! Youve allowed Joe to still come over for dinner!"", stated N. Singer, Pepper Pike, OH. <br><br>&#13;
- While D. Kleekowski found another use, ""It was almost a captive purchase, as I had accidentally spilled coffee on the seat of my car. I used Lift Off #1 according to the directions on the bottle and was amazed at how quickly and easily the coffee came up. That was almost two weeks ago, and there is no residual stain, and more importantly, no residual odor.""<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Directions for Clothes, Upholstery, Non-washables &amp; Washables:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. Test for colorfastness by spraying an inconspicuous area.<br>&#13;
2. Blot wet stains with a clean, white cloth or paper towel, if possible. Remove loose grime.<br>&#13;
3. Spray stain thoroughly; wait at least 60 seconds.<br>&#13;
4. Gently agitate (use brush if necessary), then blot with clean, white towel or cloth. Repeat if necessary. <br>&#13;
5. For best results on non-washable materials, dry with a hair dryer on medium heat.<br>&#13;
6. For best results on washable materials, launder as fabric recommendations allow.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Directions for Carpets:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. Apply according to the instructions above.<br>&#13;
2. Then place a clean, white cloth or paper towels over the treated area, followed by something flat and heavy like a phonebook. In a few hours, the towel will absorb any excess stain dampness or residue from the stain.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Other Motsenbocker Products:</u></font></strong><br><a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001805.htm""><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/custom/motsenbockers_2_sm.jpg"" alt=""Motsenbocker's #2 removes adhesive, grease, &amp; tape stains"" width=""100"" height=""130"" style=""margin: 0 10px 0 0;"" title=""Motsenbocker's #2 removes adhesive, grease, &amp; tape stains""></a>&#13;

- ""My son went off to college and we wanted to use the room as an office. Over the years, he put every sticker he owned on his bedroom door. A friend gave us a product that supposedly removes stickers, tape, etc. but it just gummed up the stickers and required hours of scraping. I was not about to sit there and scrape my life away, so I went to the hardware store and found Lift Off #2. With one or two sprays, it came off like magic and with no scraping. Thanks for making a product that really works!"" J. &amp; R. Fabian gushed about the product.<br><br>&#13;
- U. McAndrews found another use for #2 Tape Remover, ""I blew out a Christmas candle and splashed some candle wax on the front of my newly purchased cotton velour shirt. I tried your Lift Off #2 according to the instructions. I washed the shirt immediately after removing the wax. It dried looking like new.

- S. McRae found a unique use for LiftOff #3, ""Thank you for making a great product that actually does what it says it will do. I recently got some black ink from a printer cartridge on my carpet. It has been there for about two months. That is until today. I was introduced to Lift Off #3 and after two applications, and some blotting, the ink instantly started to disappear. Your product is simply amazing!""<br><br>&#13;
- D. Williams loved our product because it saved her from replacing her carpet, ""My daughter left a bottle of bright turquoise blue nail polish on our end table with the cap open, I picked it up to put it away and the cap went flying off and the entire bottle landed on my light beige carpet. After crying I pulled myself together and checked the internet for a solution. I read that your #3 product was what I should try. I sprayed, waited 60 seconds scrubbed until all the hard nail polish was out and put a paper towel over it, put a book on top of it...Noah (my 2 year old) walked over the books several times so it might have been his little feet that graced this little project but 60 minutes later the nail polish was completely gone! Amazing. I have shared this story with all my friends!

The following testimonial, was taken directly from the Motsenbocker website;<br><br>&#13;
- S. Molnar stated, ""I live in Elk Horn, PA pop. 10 people, in an old brick thick farm house built on the Monongahela River bank. It was built in 1840 by a riverboat Captain. The stairway goes from the main floor to the attic and it is all hand crafted black walnut, red oak and red pine which I found after stripping away about 18 coats of paint, stain, etc. that was put on it over the past 168 years. I bought Lift oFF at my Lowe's store in Belle Vernon and me and my friend proceeded to spend three months stripping it all. It was a major job. We tried other brands of paint strippers but Lift off worked the best. And best of all it is made in the USA, water based, and has a pleasant smell. I never thought my stairway would turn out so beautiful!!!! Thanks Lift Off!!!!<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Basic Prep Instructions:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
Prior to stripping, you should prepare and protect the surrounding areas such as furniture, cabinets, and floors. Make sure to remove all hardware, and protect areas that you do not want stripped with a quality tape or plastic.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Basic Use Instructions:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. Pour desired amount into a plastic container.<br>&#13;
2. Use of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000191.htm"">gloves</a> and <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000192.htm"">safety glasses</a> are recommended as an added measure of safety.<br>&#13;
3. Use paintbrush to apply a liberal amount of  Paint &amp; Varnish Remover in an area size up to 5x5.<br>&#13;
4. Wait at least 5-10 minutes for gel to penetrate the coating.<br>&#13;
5. Using a scraper, putty knife, or one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000027.htm"">handheld utility stripping pads</a> to strip the surface in the same direction as the grain of the wood to remove the loosened coating from the surface.<br>&#13;
6. Repeat steps as necessary for removing excessive coats or deeply ingrained stains.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Clean Up Instructions:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;
1. Use warm water and stripping pad to remove all excess coating &amp; Varnish and Paint Remover product from surface.<br>&#13;
2. Use warm water and clean towels to wash, rinse and dry surface. (Option: an alcohol rinse will enhance drying time and insure a clean and residue free surface).<br>&#13;
3. Allow product surface to dry completely up to 12 hours before refinishing.<br>&#13;
4. Place stripped paint or varnish onto a plastic sheet and allow to dry for approximately 24 hours. Since the Paint &amp; Varnish Remover is a water-based and biodegradable formula, once it has completely evaporated, the dry residue is considered inert and non-hazardous and may be disposed of safely in a trash can according to local regulations.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Other Motsenbocker Products:</u></font></strong><br><a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001804.htm""><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/custom/motsenbockers_1_sm.jpg"" alt=""Motsenbocker's #1 removes food, pet 7 protein type stains"" width=""100"" height=""130"" style=""margin: 0 10px 0 0;"" title=""Motsenbocker's #1 removes food, pet 7 protein type stains""></a>&#13;

The Fas-Trak Micro-Scrub is great for scrubbing in hard to reach areas. Our typical customers use them around toilets, into corners (where normal <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">rotary floor scrubbers</a> won't reach), and to clean and scrub baseboards. You could also use our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000027.htm"">utility handheld scrubbing pads</a> for the same tasks, but they involve a little elbow grease to remove spots, stains, and wax. Comes with a single battery, charger, and nylon brush.<br><br>&#13;
The Micro-Scrub is a revolutionary scrubber, due to it's weight of only 6 pounds, and there is no battery pack to wear. Most battery scrubbers like this have a backpack desing for the battery that you have to wear. Not the the Micro-Scrub! It has a battery that plugs into the head of the scrubber, and typically runs for 1 to 1.5 hours on a full charge. If you were to purchase a second battery, you would have almost continuous run time, because it only takes 1.5 hours to charge the battery once dead.

This <em>CleanFreak</em> burnisher with dust control uses a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000220.htm"">20 inch burnishing pad</a> and a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000044.htm"">floor burnishing solution</a> to achieve the highest shine possible on your tiled floor. This machine spins those pads at 1500 revolutions per minute to create a deep and long lasting shine. The AC motor is designed to last up to 5x longer than our typical <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000077.htm"">DC powered burnishers</a>. The AC motor will actually cut out when you are the using machine if you are drawing too many amps, which will actually help to make the machine last for years and years. We even offer this model without dust control as just a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001257.htm"">20 inch burnisher</a>, if you're looking for something a little more economical.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/dust_control_pouch.jpg"" width=""125"" height=""130"" align=""right"" alt=""Dust control pouch &amp; disposable bag"" title=""Dust control pouch &amp; disposable bag"">The dust control portion of the machine makes sure that all the dust created from burnishing your floor is recovered in a convenient dust pouch on the front of the machine for easy disposal. This dust control feature helps to eliminate airborne dust contaminants,  maintains healthy indoor air quality, and reduces labor costs. Your major labor savings are incurred by not having to recover that dust later, by either dust mopping, or scrubbing the floor again with an automatic scrubber, which in turn tends to dull the floor again.<br><br>&#13;

This wide area carpet vacuum can easily vacuum a 60,000 square foot facility on a full charge. On carpet you'll typically get about 2 full hours of vacuuming capacity when fully charged. The <em>CleanFreak</em> EasySweep comes with a 12 volt maintenance free battery and an on-board battery charger. You never have to worry about dragging around a power cord, and the vacuum can clean carpeting anywhere you want to take it!<br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

These methods are viable alternatives to rodenticide in sensitive places such as hospitals, schools, homes and other restricted use areas. House mice do not pose as serious a problem as rats, but they can be quite a nuisance. They eat and contaminate food with their urine and droppings, and they may gnaw on wiring creating a fire hazard. They can transmit some diseases.

This 18 inch electric floor scrubber by Viper, is one of the only <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/automatic-walk-behind-scrubbers.htm"">auto scrubber machines</a> that comes with a 82 foot power cord. This gives you, the user, a humongous coverage area without having to change electrical outlets. The follow behind 28"" squeegee recovers all the solution that is put down and then scrubbed with either the brush or pad, depending on what you are using at the time. Pads are great for going over smooth surfaces, like grocery store floors, and brushes are great for scrubbing uneven floors, like concrete receiving areas. We recommend getting both with your machine, so you're ready for every situation. A pad driver comes standard with the unit, and pads are sold separately, unless you purchase the package that this machine comes in, which is pictured below.<br><br><hr size=""1"">

The Fang 18C is much more than just a plain old floor scrubber. It has so many other functions! You can not only scrub your floors, but you can also strip them with this machine. We recommend using hot water with one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000010.htm"">concentrated stripping solutions</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001906.htm"">18"" black stripping pad</a>. You'll need to thoroughly clean out the recovery tank and the solution tank if you dispensed the stripper from the Fang 18C. If any type of slurry or recovered solution is left in the tanks or recovery lines, you could ruin the machine. If any stripping solution is left in the solution tank, you could ruin a future flooring job. That's why we recommend applying your stripping solution with a mop and bucket, or one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000202.htm"">wax applicator machines</a>.<br><br>&#13;

The Viper Shovelnose wet / dry vacuum comes complete with a front mount squeegee, otherwise known as a trot mop. This vacuum excels in any type of wet pickup with the front mount squeegee, but it is an essential tool in any floor stripping program. It takes out all the tedious parts of recovery, and does all the work for you. Take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">floor stripping procedure</a> page for proper step by step instructions on how to remove floor wax from commercial floors.<br><br>&#13;
This trot mop vacuum makes picking up that stripped wax a cinch!  It can be used to recover in either forward or reverse, so no movement is wasted when recovering. Make sure to thoroughly clean out the vacuum after you are finished. If any type of stripper dries with the wax in the machine, it can clog lines, causing the machine to be either highly inefficient, or the worst case scenario, completely inoperable.

Viper's 20 inch Fang comes with two 12 volt 105 amp batteries, a 12 amp charger, and a pad driver. We do sell a brush for the machine, but that is sold separately. Depending on what your looking to do with the machine, pads or brushes may be more beneficial.  Pads can be used on smooth surfaces, whiles brushes can be used on uneven floors. You can also use pads with this machine to strip floor finish off of commercial floors. We recommend using a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001517.htm"">Green floor stripper</a> in any type of commercial building or school setting. This will help to not introduce harmful chemicals to the environment.  The Green stripper may not be as effective as our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001023.htm"">Shattered 99 concentrated stripper</a>, but it is definitely more eco-friendly.<br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

The 20"" Fang is a highly maneuverable scrubber that can scrub large areas with it's 13 gallon solution tank, and it's 3.5 hour run time. Run time will depend on the type of surface being scrubbed, but you can figure about 3.5 hours on a smooth surface. This means you'll easily be able to scrub a 60,000 square foot building on a full charge. Make sure to run your batteries down before recharging, otherwise they may build a memory, and not last as long on a full charge.<br><br>&#13;

The 19 gallon solution tank ensures you will have plenty of solution to scrub the widest areas, and be able to continue without stopping to refill. This is the only 24"" scrubber on the market that is a brush driven model. We have designed the entire system, so the two pad drivers or brushes essentially pull the machine along as you scrub. All you need to do is provide a little momentum, and guide it in the correct direction. <strong>You can essentially push the machine along with a single finger while it's scrubbing!</strong><br><br><table width=""560"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""center"" class=""verdanaLinks""><tr>

The 18"" <em>Hoover Conquest</em> is one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000173.htm"">bagless upright vacuums</a> that comes with a shake out bag or the option to use disposable bags.  This allows you to remove the bag when it is full and dump it out, or use it as a standard vacuum with disposable bags.  <strong>No more buying disposable bags when using the shakeout bag!</strong> Either way you decide to use the <em>Conquest</em>, you'll experience a great cleaning recovery vacuum that leaves nothing behind. If you are an allergy sufferer, you'll definitely want to use the replacement bags, as the shakeout bag can release some of the recovered dust back into the air.<br><br>&#13;
This model is slightly larger than our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001942.htm"">14 inch Hoover® Conquest</a>, but it also has a slightly larger motor to accommodate for that extra suction that is needed to accomodate the enlarged recovery area.  They both come standard with a large object clean-out trap, that stops debris from getting into the fan. This helps to prolong the life of the vacuum by preventing damage to the fan and motor. We also have a dirt cup model available in both sizes, but the dirt cup will not hold the same amount of debris as the shake out bag model.

"500 PSI Dual Jet Carpet Cleaning Wand",EDI-1034ACH-500,"Trusted Clean 500 PSI Dual Jet Carpet Cleaning Wand<br><em>(For use with both heated &amp; non-heated machines!)</em><br><strong>Regular Price: $279.00<br><font color=""#FF0000"">Sale Price: $214.50</font></strong><br><br>&#13;
This S-bend dual jet carpet extraction wand is designed to be used with any of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000075.htm"">heated box extractors</a> that have an output pressure up to 500 PSI. The solution lines are rated to handle up to 3000 PSI, but we only offer portable carpet cleaning extractors that have a max pressure output of 500 PSI. The wnad itself is made from stainless steel and comes equipped with special hoses to withstand the high pressure and heat that some of these machines can deliver. The 2 jets provide superior coverage, and an insulated handle keeps your hands cool while allowing super hot water to be dispensed and recovered. The winged head is perfect for containing your spray, especially when cleaning underneath tables and furniture.<br><br>&#13;
If your wand will not dispense any solution, you may need to unscrew the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002182.htm"">check valve caps</a> and remove the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002400.htm"">stainless steel jet tips</a> and the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002179.htm"">check valves</a>. Clean these items out by rinsing them in a vinegar bath. All brass pieces should be replaced every 6 months, and the stainless steel jets every year. More frequently with heavy usage. If you've done all this, and you're wand still won't spray, you may need to replace the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002175.htm"">Glidemaster brass valve</a>.<br><br>&#13;
We do essentially have this same wand available in a more economical model, but it can only be used with machines that have a rated output of 250 PSI or less. These wands, plus more can be found in our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000231.htm"">carpet extractor hoses &amp; wands</a>.

An onboard tool kit with stretch hose and telescopic wand allows you to easily clean along baseboards, heating vents, and other hard to reach areas.

Never before has such a durable ultra high speed burnisher been offered at such an affordable price! This 1500 RPM machine is considered an ultra high speed burnisher, because it spins faster than 1000 RPM. Anything over that threshold of 1000 RPM, is considered a ultra high speed machine.  Take a look at our complete line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000077.htm"">electric high speed burnishers</a> for other options in this category, including our even more economical <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002202.htm"">high speed floor polishing machine</a>.<br><br> &#13;
The Task Pro 1500 RPM burnisher comes with a 5 year warranty on the power train, and 1 year on all wear items. This provides another great value for this economical machine. The flexible pad driver allows the machine to be used on any surface that has a nice coat of protective wax on it. Using this machine on a floor without any wax on it, can void the warranty due to unnecessary stress placed on the motor.<br><br>&#13;
This machine should be run on a 20 amp circuit due to the powerful motor. If a 20 amp circuit is not available, you can get by with using a more aggressive pad (which draws less resistance), and using a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000274.htm"">mop on floor restorer</a>. When using this machine with a spray buff solution and a soft pad creates more resistance and can cause your machine to constantly blow breakers.

Aztec built a machine that met every consumer need. A lightweight propane burnisher that is economically priced, and is powerful enough to polish every type of tiled floor. That is why the Aztec Reliant 21"" burnisher has been such a success with our customer base! For each and every propane powered machine that we sell, we also recommend buying a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002324.htm"">portable carbon monoxide detector</a>. This will allow the operator to monitor the exhaust fumes in all areas when you're operating this machine.<br><br>&#13;
The offset deck allows the user to easily burnish underneath racks, and into corners. Not only does the offset head give you increased coverage, but it also eliminates side torque, and dramatically increases head pressure. The 20 HP Kawasaki engine provides plenty of power to turn your pad at 2000 RPM. None of the other <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000079.htm"">propane buffers</a> that we carry, offer the same economical value that this 21"" Reliant model offers.<br><br>&#13;
This machine <strong>can not</strong> be converted to a dust control model, but we have a very similar model that can be converted for an additional charge. Please call us and ask for a price on the special order 21"" Aztec Answer with dust control. If you're looking for a more economical electric model that will accomplish the same tasks, please take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001843.htm"">1500 RPM Dust Control Burnisher</a>.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

The Aztec Reliant 24 inch propane burnishing machine was built with the contractor in mind. The adjustable  handle, rugged steel and cast aluminum body make transporting the machine easy, and using it to burnish even easier! The offset head allows to you to reach under racks, furniture, and other immovable objects that were previously impossible to get at. The 20 HP Kawasaki engine and 12 volt battery starter come standard, just like on our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002073.htm"">21"" Aztec propane burnisher</a>. This makes starting the machine anywhere, at any time, a breeze!<br><br>&#13;
This Aztec Reliant model has a low oil shutdown feature, which helps to extend the life of the Kawasaki engine. If you accidentally run the machine low on oil, rather than permanently damaging the engine, it will automatically shut down. We still recommend consistently checking the oil levels on the engine, at least before every other start up of the engine. The regulator fuel system also helps to insure the 2 year warranty that comes standard with the Reliant burnishing machines.

How do you effectively recover concrete dust and other materials from new construction. This industrial vacuum from IPC Eagle is the perfect answer. It is a dual cyclonic separator vacuum. There are two large drop down collection bins that accommodate standard contractor trash bags, which recover the material you are recovering. These trash bags make emptying and clean up of these vacuums extremely easy.<br><br>&#13;
The built-in cyclonic separator spins out 80% of the debris before it even gets to the main vacuum chamber. Not only does this help in protect your vacuum motors, but it also makes disposing of this debris easier. This is why it is the absolute perfect vacuum for concrete grinding. That dust that is created is so fine that most vacuum filters will not capture, and it will pass right through them, the motor, and the exhaust filter, sending the concrete dust right back into the air.<br><br>&#13;

You will not have to worry about this piece of equipment, it is truly an explosion proof vacuum.

Lead paint abatement is the process of safely reducing lead paint hazards. Paint removal is the most popular method of removing the lead based paint, which may be done on or off the job site. On-site paint removal often creates large amounts of lead dust, chips, and fumes. The EDIC Dynamo 5WH is the perfect lead abatement vacuum for these exact type of situations.<br><br>&#13;

The HEPA filtration captures lead dust without exhausting it back into the air for individuals to breathe. The HEPA filter needs to be cleaned frequently to ensure proper filtration on the job site. When disposing of the lead paint that was recover, you must use only waste containers that are labeled ""Danger - Lead Hazard.""<br><br>&#13;

When you need a machine that can power itself and make it up those tough inclines with minimal effort, look no further than the Task Pro wheel powered auto drive floor scrubber. The wheels are powered to keep the floor scrubber moving if you are unable to physically push it. You can even use this feature to transport the scrubber to different locations or different scrubbing areas within the same location. Nothing comes in more handy if you need to go up inclines, or even in and out of elevators.<br><br>&#13;
The scrubber itself comes with a 13 gallon solution tank, which comes in real handy in large areas. The auto drive function also comes in handy here, because pushing a large scrubber like this continuously over large areas can get to be quite tiring. A follow behind squeegee system keeps the floor dry after scrubbing, but we always recommend putting out the necessary <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000021.htm"">wet floor signs</a> to notify other employees and customers of the wet floor.<br><br> &#13;

This is a brass jet tip that is meant to be used with heated machines. It has a smaller orifice than our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002181.htm"">non-heated jet tips</a>, which allows for a smaller amount of water to be dispersed, keeping the water hotter within the wand and machine.

If your wand quits dispensing water, your tips may be clogged. If this happens remove them from the wand and rinse with warm water, or let them sit a vinegar bath to dissolve some of the build up within the tip, then rinse with hot water. If neither of these methods works, you need to replace your jet tips. You may also need to replace the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002179.htm"">check valves w/ strainers</a>, which can be found in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000261.htm"">drag wand jets &amp; parts</a> section.

These non-heated tips can be found in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000261.htm"">drag wand jets &amp; parts</a> section. There are other parts in there that may need to be replaced if your wand will not dispense solution, or has a restricted flow. We recommend soaking all parts found in the jet tip assembly in a vinegar solution to help dissolve the build up that occurs from using <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000058.htm"">extractor shampoo solutions</a>.

<br><br>&#13;
The warm up spray nozzle that comes with the heater can be used to recycle the water and heat the water in your tank while you prep the job, or it can be used to pre-spray large areas.  Simply attach the petcock to your solution line, and attach the heater to your machine. Place the petcock into the solution tank, turn on the pump, and turn on the heater. This will heat the water and recycle it back into the solution tank creating hot water. Hot water helps to breakdown stains and grime/dirt quickly to make your cleaning job easier.

The MegaSweep excels in picking up large debris and dust on construction job sites, agricultural areas, and on demolition jobs. It <span itemprop=""description"">can easily sweep a 90,000 ft² facility on a full charge.</span> The front brush pushes everything into the center of the sweeping path, where the large center broom recovers everything it comes across. A front dust flap can be lifted with the left handle trigger to allow larger items into the main broom area. Nails, scrap wood, sawdust, and other debris are no match for the Trusted Clean MegaSweep construction site sweeper!<br><br>&#13;

We also feature the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/wide-area-hallway-vacuum.htm"">wide area carpet vacuum for hallways</a> in this section, which is quite similar to the MegaSweep, except it has a smaller recovery path, and no traction drive.<br><br>&#13;
                                  For a complete sweep of your facility, including the warehouse, this is the only machine you'll need. The front dust flap can be lifted with a simple squeeze of the left trigger handle to allow larger debris and garbage to be recovered. The vacuum helps to recover fine dust into the back hopper, while larger items are thrown into the front hopper. <strong>*Note:</strong> We recommend running your battery down to nearly dead before recharging, so the battery does not develop a memory, and give you less run time.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br>&#13;

If you are looking to buy a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000850.htm"">solution tank</a> with this floor buffer, you will need to cut the end of the solution delivery line off, like in Figure 1a below. Then, you'll need to just slide it over fitting attached to the floor buffer deck as seen in Figure 1b. (Note: You may want to trim the solution delivery line to an adequate length to fit your machine so there are no loops or kinks in the line.)<br><br><hr size=""1"">

This means that it has at least a 95% customer satisfaction rating, as well as receiving at least a score of 9.0 out of 10.0 on repeated field tests. For the money, you can't pass up the value that this high speed floor polishing machine offers. With this machine you'll be able to bring that original high shine that your floor had when it was new. You can use this machine with a mop-on floor buffing product, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000274.htm"">Trusted Clean Floor Restore</a>. <strong>*Note:</strong> You do not want to spray buff with this machine, or use too soft of a pad, like a champagne burnishing pad because you may pull too many amps and blow the circuit breaker found within the handle. If this does happen, simply allow the motor to cool down, reset the breaker, and try using a more aggressive pad.<br><br><table width=""560"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""center"" class=""verdanaLinks""><tr>

This direct drive auto scrubber from Viper is much more than just a standard auto scrubber. It is a game changer. With a variable speed direct drive system, and a variable adjustable brush pressure setting, this machine does so much more than the rest of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/automatic-walk-behind-scrubbers.htm"">automatic walk behind floor scrubbers</a>. The heavy duty 215 amp hour batteries provide up to 5 hours of continuous run time. That eliminates any downtime due to dead batteries. If you cant scrub your facility in that amount of time, you should look at a larger machine like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001172.htm"">Viper 26"" auto scrubber</a>, or our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/performer-24B-industrial-scrubber.htm"">24"" CleanFreak® floor scrubber</a>.<br><br>&#13;
The warranty on this direct drive 20HD auto scrubber is unbeatable as well! 12 years on all housings, 3 years on motors, and 1 year on wear items is unheard of this industry. The only non-Viper machine to come close to this, warranty wise, is our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002167.htm"">wheel driven floor scrubber</a>.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

· A 5 hour max run time allows you plenty of time to clean the areas that need it.<br>&#13;

This not only helps to extend the life of the main filter, but it also maximizes vacuuming efficiency.

When using your EasySweep 24"" sweeper/vacuum, this main filter needs to be maintained to optimize the life and filtering efficiency of your machine. It is equipped with a rubber gasket so no fine debris can pass through it.Once a week we recommend you remove this filter and either blow it out with an air nozzle, or vacuum out with a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">wet tank vacuum</a>.<br><br> &#13;
This filter has a self cleaning mechanism within the machine that is set up according to your cleaning schedule. Even though the sweeper has a self cleaning mechanism, we still recommend pulling the filter out once a week and cleaning it to ensure their are no tears in the paper material, or it hasn't become too filthy. If the paper media becomes torn or too filthy to adequately clean, you should replace this filter immediately to protect the vacuum motors and optimize vacuuming performance of your sweeper.  This filter can be replaced without the use of any tools.<br><br>&#13;
You should make a habit of not only checking your main paper filter, but also checking on the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002207.htm"">pre-filter</a> to make sure it is not clogged with larger debris.  Each of these filters should be checked weekly, and replaced after 200 hours of vacuuming.<br><br>&#13;

This pump priming hose can be used with any of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000075.htm"">box carpet extractors</a>. It is utilized when a pump is run out of solution or hasn't been used for a long time, and becomes air locked. To break this air lock and get the solution flowing again, we recommend filling the solution tank up to create down pressure. Then you hook the female quick disconnect up to the male end coming out of the machine, and connect the stopper end to your vacuum hose. After completing those steps, you'll need to turn on both the pump and the vacuum to create suction and suck the solution through the pump.<br><br> &#13;
Our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000928.htm"">Trusted Clean 5 gallon automotive detailer</a> and our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001242.htm"">heated car upholstery detailer</a> come standard with this accessory because people tend to run these machine dry because of the smaller tank size, effectively air locking the pump.

This warm up spray nozzle has a number of uses, and can be used with any of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000075.htm"">box carpet extractors</a> that have a male quick disconnect coming off of the solution hose. Here is a list of various uses for this tool;<br><br><strong>1.)</strong> It can be used as water recycling tool to heat up the water in your extractor as you prepare the area that needs to cleaned. Simply attach it to the solution line and place in the solution tank. Then turn on the pump, and once the water starts to flow, turn on the heater.<br><br><strong>2.)</strong> It can be used as a pre-spray tool to spray down the carpeted areas before you attempt to clean them. This gives the solution a chance to do it's job before it is worked in further or recovered.<br><br><strong>3.)</strong> It can be used to empty out your solution tank. We don't recommend this if there is a lot of solution left in the tank, as this can put unnecessary stress on the pump of your machine. It is much more efficient to use the recovery hose and suck out all the unused solution.<br><br><strong>4.)</strong> Last but not least, it can be used to prime your pump. First place this fitting on the end of your solution line. Then stick this nozzle into the end of the vacuum hose and create as much of a seal as possible by filling the remaining area with a rag. Once you have accomplished these tasks, simply switch on the vacuum and pump switches, and the air that is locked into the pump should be sucked out. (<strong>*Please Note:</strong> Do not allow your rag to be sucked completely up by the vacuum hose.) We have a much more handy tool available, which is called our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002223.htm"">Carpet Extractor Pump Priming Hose</a>, but this nozzle will work as well.<br><br>&#13;

Lysol's Mold &amp; Mildew Remover with Bleach is breakthrough mold removal product that not only kills mold &amp; mildew, but it also inhibits it from returning. Each case contains 12 quarts to effectively treat infected areas. This solution is extremely potent and needs to be used with caution due to the bleach contained within.  To be 100% effective, the solution must remain on the affected area for 5 minutes to effectively kill and remove all active mold spores. If the odors are too powerful, you may want to leave the area while the solution works. Individuals with asthma or allergies may want to use a mask while using this mold and mildew removing solution. Some additional agitation from one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000027.htm"">handheld scrubbing pads</a> or other materials may be needed to thoroughly remove all mold and mildew. Expect the area to be treated to kill mold, and inhibit it from returning. Not all staining will necessarily be removed, so some treating/re-painting may be needed to make the area look like new again. This mold &amp; mildew removal spray can be found in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000059.htm"">restroom surface cleansers &amp; cleaners</a> category.<br><br>&#13;
Avoid contact with clothes, fabric, wood, rubber, carpet, painted/paper surfaces, non-porous vinyl surfaces, and finished floors.

This <em>CleanFreak</em> heated carpet extractor &#13;
uses hot water and an adjustable glide wand to &#13;
remove as much dirt from your carpets as &#13;
mechanically possible. The hot water severs the &#13;
bond between the dirt and the carpet fibers, &#13;
allowing it to be recovered by the drag wand. The &#13;
single jet wand, which is pictured below, has an &#13;
adjustable glide that consistently recovers 30% &#13;
more solution on each pass than traditional <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000231.htm&#13;%0A"">drag wands</a>. For more information on how the &#13;
<a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002308.htm&#13;%0A"">adjustable glide drag wand</a> is able to &#13;
accomplish what it does, please take a look at its &#13;

cleaning power you may want to consider our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002546.htm&#13;%0A"">Heated 500 PSI Portable Extractor</a>, which is &#13;

"Deck Cleaning Pressure Washer",CAM-AR116,"Blue Clean AR116 Deck Cleaning Pressure Washer<br><em>(1450 PSI, 1.35 GPM, 120 Volt)</em><br><strong>Regular Price: $228.00<br><font color=""#FF0000"">Sale Price: $146.79</font></strong><br><br>&#13;
If you're looking for a pressure washer to clean your decks in the spring or fall, you'll need to look no further, because this is the model for you! With 1450 PSI, you'll have more than enough power to clean the typical wood or vinyl deck. If you have something with much more power than that, you can actually leave spray marks in the wood, and possibly remove some of the paint from vinyl. The solution that you use will have more effect on cleaning your deck than the pressure used to spray it down. A great general use <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000008.htm"">soap</a>, is our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001227.htm"">super concentrated blue clean</a>. And, for more heavy duty jobs, a great <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000224.htm"">degreaser</a> would be our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000261.htm"">low foaming degreaser</a>.<br><br> &#13;
To make sure you get the best clean possible, we also recommend adding one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000243.htm"">deck scrub brushes</a> to your cleaning arsenal. Something like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001946.htm"">wood block deck scrub brush</a> has stiff enough bristles to thoroughly scrub out those extra stubborn stains on your deck.<br><br>&#13;
The Blue Clean AR116 deck cleaning pressure washer is part of our larger <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000100.htm"">electric hand carry power washers</a> department. This is going to be the most economical model we have to offer in that department. Even though it is priced economically, it outperforms many units that are twice as expensive. With the 1450 PSI Triplex pump, quick garden disconnect, adjustable spray wand, foam dispenser, 20' high pressure hose, and detergent injector kit, it's hard to call this a residential unit, but yet it is!<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></font><br> &#13;
· The pump's Total Stop System cuts water off when you release the trigger and sprays it out as soon as press the trigger down.<br>&#13;
· 1450 max PSI is more than enough power to clean wood or vinyl decks without damaging anything.<br>&#13;
· Detergent injector kit allows you to dispense the correct solution as you spray.<br>&#13;
· Adjustable spray nozzle allows the user to adjust from a fine pencil sized spray to a large fanned out pattern.<br>&#13;
· 20' high pressure hose and with a weight of only 19 pounds, makes this unit extremely portable.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

This swivel scouring pad holder is very similar to our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001802.htm"">Octopus mop handle swivel pad holder</a>, but this model is even more durable because it only takes a threaded mop handle, not any handle. When it screws on to the mop handle, you get more leverage and 0% chance that the handle will slip out, unless you unscrew it. The <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001237.htm"">telescopic mop handle</a>, <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002108.htm"">black metal threaded handle</a>, and <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001948.htm"">wood threaded handle</a> are all very popular handles that can be used with this pad holder.<br><br>&#13;
You'll never have to deal with that back pain associated with getting down on your hands and knees and scrubbing scuff marks off of your floor. With any of the above mentioned pad holders, you'll be able to scour/buff out these marks from a standing position. This also gives you the advantage of  additional down force onto the scouring surface.

With Misco's Elements Soy Based Bio Solvent Degreaser, you get a versatile peroxide powered cleaner degreaser that is solvent free. It is comparable in cleaning strength to our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000258.htm"">orange natural citrus degreaser cleaner</a>, but without the expensive and volatile d-Limonene ingredient. As you look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000224.htm"">degreasing solutions</a>, you'll find that none perform quite like this so based product!<br><br> &#13;
Whether you're using this product to <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/wet-mopping.htm"">mop on a floor</a>, <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/floor-buffer-scrubbing.htm"">scrub with a buffer</a>, or <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/automatic-floor-scrubbing.htm"">scrub with an auto scrubber</a>, you'll find that it breaks down heavy oil based deposits like no other! The bio-renewable solvents are derived from soybean oil and corn, making it an eco-friendly and economical alternative to all degreasers, especially those based mainly on a d-Limonene ingredient. The Misco Elements Bio-Solvent Degreaser is perfect for removing deposits of grease, grime, dirt, tar, inks, paint, adhesives, and oil residues. This water-rinsable product meets the requirements of all Federal and State VOC regulations.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

Powered by a 600 watt in-line heater, this heated &#13;
carpet spot cleaner will heat the water/solution &#13;
in the tank to a maximum temperature of 200° F. &#13;
You'll dispense this solution through a 15' hose &#13;
and 3-3/8"" stainless steel tool onto fabric, &#13;
upholstery, or carpet, depending on what needs &#13;

few moments, you'll recover everything with that &#13;
same tool. A rinse cycle may be needed to remove &#13;
all the solution from the material being cleaned. &#13;
The recovery tank easily lifts off for dumping of &#13;
those recovered solutions. There is also a spin &#13;

Not only do you get a compact and portable carbon monoxide detector that can be clipped onto a collar or vest, to be near the breathing area, but it also can be set to beep when levels of CO are unsafe.

It is the only brush driven 24"" walk behind scrubber on the market. We removed the traction drive system to cut down on the initial cost of the machine, and to eliminate possible maintenance items. Without the drive system, the Performer 24 is still incredibly easy to maneuver and scrub with. <strong>You can essentially push the machine along with a single finger while scrubbing!</strong><br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

After you're done dumping the recovered solution &#13;
from the lift off recovery tank, you can spin off &#13;
the top cap and further rinse out the inside of &#13;
the tank. Make sure to do this while the tank is &#13;
removed from the base unit, otherwise you could &#13;
pour water down into the vacuum motor. Once the &#13;
tank is thoroughly clean out return it to the base &#13;
unit, and leave the top cap off. This will allow &#13;
the tank to dry out and avoid it from developing &#13;
serious odors.<br><br>&#13;

With this <em>CleanFreak</em> Carpet Extraction Cleaner, you get a fool proof carpet cleaning solution. It can be used in any of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000074.htm"">self-contained carpet scrubbers</a>, <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000131.htm"">carpet spotters</a>, or <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000075.htm"">box extractors</a> without worry. The low pH (between 3.0 - 6.0) makes it powerful enough to clean mildly soiled carpets, yet it's gentle enough on the carpet fibers to safely be applied on any type of carpeting. This being said, we still recommend testing an inconspicuous area for color fastness, before cleaning entire areas.<br><br>&#13;
If you're dealing with extremely soiled areas, you may want to look at something like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000279.htm"">carpet &amp; upholstery cleaner</a>, which has a much higher pH of 11.5. Both of these products, plus more can be found in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000058.htm"">extractor shampoo solutions</a> category.<br><br>&#13;
We recommend mixing this carpet extractor cleaning solution at 2 ounces of chemical per 1 gallon of water for normal extraction duties. It can also be used to scrub carpets with a bonnet, where you would want to mix it at 12 to 16 ounces per gallon of water. And, finally if using it for pre-treatment of carpets, you'll want to mix 16 to 24 ounces per gallon of water.

With the <em>CleanFreak</em> Carpet Encapsulation Cleaner, you get an interim cleaner that not only effectively cleans all types of carpeting, but it also continues to clean your carpeting every time you vacuum. The encapsulation technology effectively surrounds dirt and soils to eliminate their""stickiness"" and allow them to be vacuumed up, instead of staying attached to the carpet fibers and attracting other dirt.<br><br>&#13;
Simply pre-mix the correct amount, and pre-spray your intended cleaning area with one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000129.htm"">pump up sprayers</a> (it is best to start in small, sectioned areas). Then scrub with one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">rotary floor buffers</a>, and several <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000176.htm"">carpet bonnets</a>. Then simply allow the area to dry, and routinely vacuum. The greatest part of this process, is that no additional work is needed after the initial cleaning The commercial institutions, should already have a routine vacuuming schedule set that will continue to clean the carpet over time.<br><br>&#13;
Safe for use on wool carpets, upholstery, stain resistant and standard carpets. This process should be used only as interim commercial cleaning tool, and not as replacement to <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/carpet-cleaning-extraction.htm"">full carpet extraction</a>. A full extraction of the carpet should occur after every 2 -3 encapsulation cleanings.<br><br>&#13;

The chevron brush has a 26"" width, and the side gap has a 2"" space for edge cleaning, providing 28"" of total area cleaning. The brush helps draw dirt into the vacuum shoe and propels the vacuum forward, making it one of the easiest <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/wide-area-vacuums.htm"">wide area carpet vacuums</a> to use.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

· The L-shape/low profile is designed to clean around and under furniture with wrap around bumper to protect walls and furniture from damage.<br>&#13;
· Chevron pattern brush with four rows of bristles is designed for grooming.  Dirt and debris is moved towards the center, while the ""no-fling"" brush barrier contains and directs the dirt and debris into the oversized vacuum inlet for maximum pickup.<br>&#13;
· Chrome plated steel handle folds down for convenient storage and quick transport.<br>&#13;
· The unit's pile height adjusts to five settings allowing for maximum cleaning efficiency.<br>&#13;

<p>The pump will dial all the way down to 100 PSI for that delicate upholstery cleaning. The <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002399.htm"">high pressure tile recovery vacuum hose</a>, as well as <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000167.htm"">upholstery tools</a> are sold separately. We recommend using the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001997.htm"">500 PSI Dual Jet Carpet Cleaning Wand</a> for any carpet cleaning, because it can cover the pressure from the low end pump, as well as the lowest setting on the high end pump. Vacuum cuffs are 1½ in diameter. This allows you to personalize the machine to your needs. The higher end pump is used primarily for tile and grout cleaning.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/endeavor-with-spinner.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""232"" align=""right"" alt=""Endeavor with tile cleaning spinner tool"" title=""Endeavor with tile cleaning spinner tool"">The <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002362.htm"">high pressure tile cleaning tool</a> can be used to clean tiled surfaces. If the pump becomes air locked, simply turn the knob (check the diagram) on the back of the unit to allow the vacuum motors to suck water through the pump, essentially self-priming it. When using the spinner tool, you can put down a ton of solution to thoroughly clean grout lines, and other hard to clean stains from hard surfaces.<br><br>&#13;
The vacuum motors are run in parallel. This means that they are mounted next to each, not in series, where one vacuum pulls air through the other vac motor. Mounting them in parallel creates more airflow, which is crucial on hard surfaces where the suction from the motor can seal a tool onto the floor. When this happens, you restrict the natural airflow, so increasing the air flow helps in recovering water off of hard surfaces.<br><br>&#13;
EDIC really sat down and took their time when designing the <em>Endeavor</em>. Every feature was well thought out and tested. The rear of the machine has large wheels for going up and down stairs, or loading/unloading from vans or trucks. The handle has smaller caster sized wheels mounted directly to it, allowing you to literally wheel the machine down a ramp, or out of the back of a pickup. Single operator loading and unloading makes your employees even more efficient! All of the controls are located on the front of the machine for easy viewing. A spinner/wand holder is inlaid into the front of the machine, so you can carry all your necessary tools with you as you clean. The top of the machine is also outfitted to hold a 5 gallon bucket for filling and dumping. Auto fill/dump connections are standard.<br><br>&#13;

With the Bissell dual motor upright vacuum, you get a commercially rated high efficiency suction motor with a powerful brush roll motor.

The recovery hose screws into the bag chamber so there is no way it can detach from the base while vacuuming with the recovery tool. Other features included are a pigtail cord that plugs into a 50' extension cord,  self adjusting brush head, and a built-in circuit breaker with automatic shut off to protect the brush roll motor.<br><br>&#13;

stage high performance vacuum motors. A <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001997.htm&#13;%0A"">500 PSI wand</a> and a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001621.htm&#13;%0A"">25' hose set</a> is included with the extractor, &#13;
so you'll just need to add your chemicals to clean &#13;
immediately after delivery. The &#13;
lightweight/compact tank and large transport &#13;
wheels make this carpet cleaning machine the &#13;
perfect addition to any truckmount system. You can &#13;
take this machine into unreachable areas, and &#13;
still experience the amount of power you're used &#13;
to with your truckmount.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/extreme-&#13;%0Aextractor-500psi-gauge.jpg"" width=""125"" height=""125"" align=""right"" alt=""500 psi extractor &#13;
dial, gauge, and cleanable filter"" title=""500 psi &#13;
extractor dial, gauge, and cleanable filter"" style=""margin: 0 0 0 5px"">Located on the lower &#13;
rear control panel, you'll see the adjustable psi &#13;
gauge, pump psi control knob, and a cleanable &#13;
filter. The pump control knob allows you to adjust &#13;
the pressure of solution spraying out the wand, &#13;
while the gauge helps you dial the exact pressure &#13;
in that you need for the job. The filter should be &#13;
removed and cleaned prior to every job. This 500 &#13;
PSI pump is extremely vulnerable to dirt and &#13;
foreigh objects, so you'll want the water flowing &#13;
through it as clean as possible.<br><br><strong>*Please Note:</strong> If you're pump will &#13;
not dispense the full 500 PSI, first check the &#13;
filter to make sure it is free from obstruction. &#13;
If it is not clogged, the internal regulator may &#13;
be stuck in place. Simply lower the pressure dial &#13;
down to almost 0 and spray out. Then dial the &#13;
machine back up to full pressure. This may need to &#13;
be repeated a few times to reach full pressure &#13;
output.<br><br>&#13;
The Trusted Clean Supreme 500 PSI carpet cleaning &#13;
machine offers the most power, in both both &#13;
pressure and suction, in a single corded extractor &#13;
ever! Take a look at our full line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000075.htm&#13;%0A"">carpet cleaning box extractors</a> for more &#13;

valve"" style=""margin: 0 5px 0 0"">If you're having &#13;
problems priming your machine's pump, don't fret, &#13;
we've got you covered! The lever located just &#13;
above the male quick disconnect on the back of the &#13;
machine is used to accomplish this task. If you &#13;
can't get any water to spray out, simply turn on &#13;
your vac motors and depress the lever. This will &#13;
create suction in the water delivery line, &#13;
essentially sucking the water through the line. &#13;
You can also use this lever to alleviate the &#13;
pressure in the lines when trying to disconnect &#13;
your tools.<br><br><hr size=""1"">

"15 Amp Rectifier for 1½HP Imperial Motor",NEW-65K1030,"15 Amp Bridge Rectifier for 1½ HP Imperial Motor<br><em>(Fits most floor burnisher motors)</em><br><strong>Regular Price: $28.95<br><font color=""#FF0000"">Sale Price: $18.86</font></strong><br><br>&#13;
This 15 amp bridge rectifier fits most floor burnisher motors. It is made specifically for Imperial motors that are rated at 1.5 horsepower. If you are consistently replacing this rectifier on your burnisher, you should first take a look at our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/burnishing-a-floor.htm"">floor burnishing procedures</a>. The most common problem we have found is when the burnisher is started on the floor instead of starting it in a leaned back position, and then slowly lowering the head onto the floor. When starting the machine on the floor, you are creating a ton of drag which pulls more electricity through this rectifier. Over time this will overload and weaken the rectifier, effectively burning it our. Starting the machine while it is tilted back, and then lowering it onto the floor will lessen the load put on the rectifier, effectively lengthening its life span.<br><br>&#13;

With the <em>CleanFreak</em> 20"" dual purpose &#13;
floor machine, you get a multi-use machine that &#13;
can scrub, buff, polish, and strip hard floors. &#13;
You can utilize the low speed (175 rpm) for &#13;
scrubbing and stripping, where as the high speed &#13;
(320 rpm) can be utilized for buffing and &#13;
polishing. This 1.5 horsepower machine really &#13;
excels at everything you throw at. It weighs a &#13;
hefty 101 lbs. for more than adequate scrubbing &#13;
and stripping pressure on normal tiled floors.<br><br>&#13;
You would be hard pressed to find a more durable &#13;
floor machine out of all the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000182.htm&#13;%0A"">dual speed rotary floor buffers</a> that we &#13;
currently carry. With a cast iron chassis, a &#13;
reinforced epoxy coated shroud, and a chromed &#13;
steel handle, you'd really have to drop this &#13;
machine out of the back of a truck or van to hurt. &#13;
It has powered through everything we've ever &#13;
thrown at it, and done it with ease!<br><br>&#13;
We do have a few more economical models available, &#13;
including our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002150.htm&#13;%0A"">2 Speed Floor Scrubbing Buffer</a>, and our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001165.htm&#13;%0A"">Dual Speed Floor Buffer</a>. You could also take &#13;
a look at our low speed (175 rpm) <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm&#13;%0A"">rotary floor scrubbing buffers</a>, which tend &#13;
to be more economical than our dual purpose &#13;
machines.<br><br><font color=""#0000FF""><strong><u>Features:</u>&#13;
</strong></font><br>&#13;
· Triple planetary all steel transmission is the &#13;
most durable in the industry. <br>&#13;

a floor, all with the same machine. <br>&#13;

When you dry strip a floor you don't need a mop bucket - a popular place to hide contraband.  This square stripper vacuums up the dust created by dry stripping a floor. It's heavy-duty, high-quality components prepare floors to be refinished in half the time compared to <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">conventional stripping processes</a>. Chemical-free stripping is extremely valuable for cleaning up to the edge and into corners in every room. There is also stripper run-off and no ruined floors under doorways.<br><br>&#13;
Mercury's square scrubbing floor machine is the only model in the industrial that comes equipped with a backpack vacuum for immediate recovery of stripped materials. When you're doing a deep scrub, or dry strip, there will be a ton of dust created, and when you have the vacuum running as you work, a majority of these materials are immediately recovered. The machine itself has precision balanced weight distribution for safe, even and aggressive cleaning/stripping with low vibration. It also has large non-marking wheels allow for clean transport to protect the vulnerable flooring area that has already been stripped.<br><br>&#13;

This red rectangular pad has many uses. It can be used to hold other pads onto the bottom of your dry stripping machine, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002489.htm"">CleanFreak Rectangular Dry Strip Machine</a>, or it can be used for light cleaning and buffing. When using very thin pads, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002488.htm"">Brown Rectangular Dry Strip Pads</a>, you need a buffer pad between the pad driver and the pad itself. If you do not use a buffer pad, the bristles from the pad driver can gouge through that extremely thin strip pad and damage the floor. For the same  reason, this red pad must be used as a spacer with the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002611.htm"">square scrub abrader plate</a> and all of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000288.htm"">rectangular floor sanding screens</a>.<br><br>&#13;
When used individually, these red square scrub pads remove light scuff marks and dirt while producing a high gloss shine. However, we do recommend that you <b>use 2 pads at the same time</b> - this helps lower the chance your scrub machine will accidentally contact the floor during use.  You get 5 pads per case with each case purchased. You can extend the lives of these pads by simply rotating them when they become slightly clogged when buffing, and by rinsing them out after each and every use. A rectangular pad like this is intended to be used with one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000278.htm"">dry stripping floor machines</a>, sometimes also known as oscillating floor scrubbers.<br><br>&#13;

(<strong>Please Note:</strong> Even though these pads will do a great job in stripping the top layers of wax off, they will never remove 100% of the old wax off of the floor. To accomplish this, you'll need to perform a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">wet chemical strip</a>.)You'll be most effective when using these pads as a dry stripping pad, but you can use them wet as well. We do, however, recommend using our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002484.htm"">black rectangular pads</a> for wet stripping, as they tend to perform the best in wet strip situations.<br><br>&#13;
When you are using these Eco-Prep pads in dry environment, you <i>don't</i> have to maintain a mop bucket or wet/dry vacuum next to you as you work, picking up the slurry as you go. Not only do you improve your efficiency, but you also improve your total cost to redo a floor, as no <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000010.htm"">stripping chemicals</a> are needed.<br><br>&#13;
Each case that you purchase comes with 10 pads that are ¼"" thick. All rectangular pads like this one, can be found in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000280.htm"" title=""Pads - Square, Buff, Scrub &amp; Strip"">Square Scrub Pads</a> department, and are intended to be used with one of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000278.htm"">dry stripping floor machines</a>.<br><br><br><div align=""center"">&#13;

With the <em>CleanFreak</em> dry surface strip machine, you get a wet and dry surface floor stripping machine that can handle anything you can throw at it! It especially excels in top coat dry stripping and complete floor stripping without the use of any chemicals. (<strong>Please Note:</strong> To thoroughly remove 100% of the old wax from a floor, you will need to do a full <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">wet strip</a>.) This is the most flexible floor machine on the market! The cast iron deck and limited vibration handle make sure you have enough down pressure to do the job, but yet won't vibrate so bad that you can only use the machine for a limited amount of time.<br><br>&#13;
It is such a versatile machine, that when you're working in older buildings with outdated electrical systems you won't have to worry about your machine not starting up because of limited power. It will start and run in older buildings due to the motor being able to run at lower voltages. You also won't end up blowing circuits when you're operating in facilities with questionable wiring, because of the low 9 amp electrical draw.  Add to that the great feature of being able to strip floors with no water or other <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000010.htm"">stripping solutions</a>, and you've got the most versatile machine on the market. All that, plus an unbeatable price point!<br><br>&#13;
We also offer some optional accessories to purchase with this machine, which are the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002522.htm"">dust control kit</a>, additional <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002521.htm"">22 pound weights</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002523.htm"">replacement isolators kit</a>. We also offer a 4 gallon solution tank dispenser with T-connect and a 6 amp pigtail outlet kit (Please <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/contacts.htm"">give us a call</a> to special order these if you're interested). Any one of these accessories will help you tackle your floor stripping job with ease and professionalism.<br><br><table width=""100%"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" border=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

Have you ever seen a blue mop bucket with a sidepress wringer? Well, now we have them. Using a mop bucket (and other cleaning equipment) other than yellow can be an effective way to signal to people its sole use.  A yellow bucket can be used for anything - and usually is. If you're concerned about reducing or eliminating cross contamination between restroom and kitchens, for example, then it's time for color-specific equipment. Here are some of the recommended uses for the different colors (there is no universal color standards, so feel free to use a system that works in your own facilities):&#13;

With the Mytee 7000DX Flood Hog you get extra power for improved water removal. The Mytee design team added a second 3-stage HP vacuum motor which increases the water lift to 144"", letting you remove even more water from your floors than ever before.  There's also a powerful discharge pump that handles a whopping 70 gallons per minute - more than twice that of competitor models.  Mytee put in their exclusive Lint Hog, a stainless-steel mesh filter that captures debris and prevents internal damage to your machine.  This filter is easy to access and clean during your routine maintenance. <br><br>&#13;
The recovery wand comes with 2 different heads.  A scalloped head is most effective on carpeting, while the squeegee head is for hard surfaces like tile or concrete.  Two 25-foot hoses hook onto either end of the machine - one for intake and one for discharge.<br><br>&#13;

The Hawk Raptor oscillating floor stripping buffer, utilizes a ""green"" process that has the ability to remove several layers of floor finish without water or chemicals.  By reducing/eliminating the amount of water and chemicals used, the process becomes inherently safer for the operator and all personnel, as well as making the <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/stripping-a-floor.htm"">floor stripping process</a> more eco-friendly.  This ""green"" process reduces the potential for slips and falls, reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, and reduces the amount of waste waste introduced into the environment.<br><br>&#13;
Due to the fact that the process is completed dry, in most cases, all that is required is a dry vacuum to clean up the dust. However, it can also be done with just water, or with water and chemicals.<br><br>&#13;
The main advantage to the Hawk Raptor, and our other <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000278.htm"">Dry Stripping Floor Machines</a>, is in their rectangular design.  This feature allows the operator to get into the corners efficiently without getting on their hands and knees and scrubbing this area by hand.  You can't do this with a conventional <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000080.htm"">rotary floor buffer</a>.  Another advantage, is the ability to cut a straight line up against a wall. Furthermore, learning to operate the Raptor can be done in minutes.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

You've been hearing that your cleaning colleagues are starting to use color-coded systems for their cleaning equipment.  But, you're unsure about buying all that extra equipment. Never fear, there's a very good reason for color coordinating some of your cleaning equipment arsenal: reducing cross-contamination from areas of high bacterial and viral loads to areas where you customers sleep and eat. Having color-specific equipment that stays in a certain area can help significantly with reducing the spread of disease-causing germs.<br><div style=""padding:20px;margin:10px;border:1px solid #999999;"">&#13;
<strong>Recommended Color Uses:</strong><br>&#13;
· <font style=""color:#CC0000;font-weight:bold;"">Red</font> - Use in areas where risk of cross-contamination and exposure to infectious materials is high.  Or where body fluid, fecal material, or urine needs to be cleaned up.<br>&#13;

This rugged 2000 RPM burnisher by Viper is a great tool for keeping your floors nice and shiny. So easy to use you can control it with your fingertips. The quick release for the handle is even right next to the controls so there's no bending over to unscrew a knob in order to fold the handle down. The flexible pad driver (included with the burnisher) is accompanied by an LED pad pressure indicator that lets you know the appropriate amount of pressure as you burnish your floor. This economical workhorse of a machine comes standard with passive dust control. Dust from your floor is drawn into an internal cloth bag which can easily be emptied and cleaned. Engineered by Viper to withstand heavy daily use in a variety of commercial and industrial applications from schools and hospitals to sports complexes and meeting halls.<br><br>&#13;

Nyco Coil Cleaner will remove dirt, debris,  and oxidation film from coils and fins on air conditioning units, humidifiers, condensers, and heat exchange equipment. Accumulated dirt and grime on an air conditioning unit or heat pump will block airflow across the coil, increasing the cost of heating or cooling the building. In addition, a blocked evaporator coil can cause the HVAC compressor to run at above average temperatures, thus shortening the life of the compressor motor itself. When the coils and fins are clean, air circulates more fully and the systems will operate more efficiently. This will improve the overall performance of the cooling system and will also help to lower electrical costs. Our product is easy to use and will keep all types of air conditioning units running at peak performance levels.<br><br>&#13;

The Pacific Floorcare S-20 Orbital Scrubber is a 20 inch automatic floor scrubbing machine that may very well be the best value in auto scrubbers. It can scrub, top strip and full on strip all hard floor surfaces with wax on them. The rectangular head design allows you to get right up next to walls and cut a line, as well as scrub directly into a corner. You'll never have to get down on your hands and knees and use a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002079.htm"">stripping hand pad</a> again!<br><br>&#13;
Not only does this machine feature specifications and attributes you would find in the premium price ranges, but at a mid-market price, but it also comes with an outstanding warranty! It is the only orbital scrubber (with a handle, or as an auto scrubber), that comes with a warranty on its isolators. In fact, some competitors make you change these isolators out every 250 hours. Not Pacific Floorcare! They give you a 2 year or 1200 hour warranty on these exact same isolators. Like we said before this is truly a premium machine at a mid-level price!<br><br>&#13;
It comes with an on-board ""1, 2, 3 step"" visual guide so any operator can step right up and easily use the machine. The Pacific Floorcare S-20 comes with an on-board charger, so when the operator is done, he/she can simply plug it into the nearest outlet and it will be ready to go again tomorrow. <strong>*Please Note:</strong> We always recommend running your batteries down until they're completely dead before recharging. This will ensure that the batteries don't retain a memory and shorten the run cycle times.</p>&#13;

These 120 grit sanding screens are designed to let you strip/sand your soft finished floor with or without water. These sand screen discs are constructed with water proof resins and silicon carbide abrasives on both sides. Each screen has an open mesh construction to eliminate loading up of sawdust and debris. These discs are commonly used for removal or repair of coatings on wood floor surfaces. An ideal application would be refinishing gym floors. They are also used for repair of painted floor surfaces.<br><br>&#13;

3. Substantial cost savings per liner.<br>&#13;
4. When they are properly made, HMW/HD liners will rarely ""zipper"" if punctured.<br>&#13;
