<br>&#13;
The active agent in Bru-Clean TbC is sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), pronounced Di - chloro - iso - cy - an - ur - ate.&#13;
<p>While it does provide chlorine for disinfection purposes, it is not a hypochlorite, as is bleach. The chemistry and mode of action of NaDCC is significantly different, providing a product that is more effective and more stable than hypochlorites, particularly in the presence of organic contaminants. Also, unlike bleach, these NaDCC tablets contain a detergent, which provides the use-solution with cleaning properties and a lower surface tension, allowing it to penetrate into cracks and crevices to kill microbes.</p>&#13;
<p>NaDCC is an organic chlorine donor that forms a use-solution with a pH of 6 - 7, when mixed with water. Bleach and other hypochlorites, are inorganic chlorine donors, that form alkaline use-solutions, with a pH above 7. There is a huge difference in the anti-microbial efficacy and the stability of the use-solution of these two different types of compounds, even with the pH change as small as that which we see involved in this case, from 6.5 (NaDCC) to 7.5(bleach).</p>&#13;
<p>When NaDCC is mixed with water, it yields hypochlorus acid (HOCL) and monosodiumcyanurate (NaOCl) in an acid use- solution. These two ingredients remain in a constant 50 - 50 ratio in the use-solution, so that as part of the free chlorine is used up (due to reaction with bacteria, organic material, etc), part of the combined chlorine in the NaOCl is freed to restore the 50 - 50 ratio and continue the disinfecting process. <u>THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC of Bru-Clean TbC to note , because unlike bleach and all other hypochlorites , this product possesses a reserve killing power that continues to be made available even after contact with organic soils.</u><b> Bleach would immediately be de-activated on contact with organic soils.</b></p>&#13;
<p>Studies show that undissociated hypochlorus acid (HOCl) has four times the anti-microbial killing power of that associated with hypochlorites. It is believed that this is due to the fact that HOCl is very similar to the structure of HOH (water), of similar molecular size, and is electrically neutral - thus allowing it to penetrate cell walls as easily as water. It is AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC of Bru-Clean TbC, that when it is diluted, it results in a slightly acidic use - solution in which over 90% of the HOCL is undissociated. This makes it many times more reactive against microbes than is bleach. With bleach, only 10% of the HOCl remains undissociated, as it quickly dissociates into H+ and the hypochlorite ion, OCL-. The hypochlorite ion is electrically charged, and is otherwise, dissimilar to water.</p>&#13;
<p>Bleach, which is very reactive, unstable, and very sensitive to light and higher temperatures, begins to degrade almost from the moment it is made. Within a month of being manufactured, it can easily lose a third or more of its activity - losing most of its activity as quickly as two months. Once bleach is mixed with water, it can lose activity so fast that it should be discarded within 1 - 2 hours. Unless activity levels are tested when the hypochlorites are diluted, there is no legal assurance that there is sufficient anti microbial activity for the disinfection task being addressed. Bru-Clean TbC does not show this type of sensitivity in its tablet form and can be used throughout the day, after being diluted with water.</p>&#13;
<p>Testing on metal substrates demonstrates that Bru-Clean TbC is about 50% less corrosive then bleach.</p>&#13;
<p>The rate at which the tablets dissolve in water is temperature sensitive. In warm water the tablets will typically dissolve in about 2 1/2 minutes, while in cold water it can easily take 5 - 6 minutes.</p>"

Film off can also be used as a carpet rinse with an extractor, like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p002307.htm"">hot water carpet extractor</a>, to remove that graying effect that can occur after carpet cleaning. The carpet can be left in alkaline condition when using a powerful cleaning agent and will need to be neutralized, much like a floor, to achieve a truly natural state. You can read more about these procedures in our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/procedures/carpet-cleaning-extraction.htm"">carpet cleaning extraction instructions</a> guide.<br><br> &#13;

If you are looking to buy a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000850.htm"">solution tank</a> with this floor buffer, you will need to cut the end of the solution delivery line off, like in Figure 1a below. Then, you'll need to just slide it over fitting attached to the floor buffer deck as seen in Figure 1b. (Note: You may want to trim the solution delivery line to an adequate length to fit your machine so there are no loops or kinks in the line.)<br><br><hr size=""1"">

This liquid propane fueled power washer is the mobile detailers best friend. It offers extreme power (variable pressure up to 1000 PSI), heat, and the most cost efficient price out of our full line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000121.htm"">LP/Natural Gas fired pressure washers</a>. With a 50' hose, this power washer can stay mounted to a cart or trailer as you move around and spray down whatever needs to be cleaned. Since it is heated by propane, the unit must be operated in a well ventilated area, preferable outdoors. The exhaust fumes from this unit can prove to be fatal if ingested directly, or inhaled for extended periods of time. Cam Spray's forced air burner technology with electronic ignition makes it extremely easy to fire up, and keeps it burning cleanly and efficiently for the entire job.<br><br>&#13;
The power washer itself is powered by electricity, and needs a 25 amp circuit. It comes with a 35' power cord with a GFCI plug. Perfect for use with generators, as an on the go, mobile detail station. We also have this exact model available as a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p000670.htm"">natural gas fired pressure washer</a>.

The IPC Eagle Products line of <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000090.htm"">polyethylene and stainless wet/dry vacuums</a> now includes a wet vac with automatic discharge. Discharging liquid simultaneously with pick-up eliminates the time-consuming task of dumping every few minutes during a large job. On jobs where the liquid needs to be segregated, it can be directed by hose to a holding or recovery area. A garden hose adaptor is included so you can use a regular old garden hose to dispense your liquid.<br><br>&#13;
Individual switches for the vacuum and pump are located on the front of the vacuum, which means you can maneuver the wet vacuum to numerous places and recover the water before turning on the pump to empty the reservoir tank. If you wish to have them both running simultaneously, the pump will be able to handle up to 48 gallons per minute.<br><br><img src=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qimages/pump-out-vacs-tool-kit.jpg"" alt=""Pump Out Vacuum Tool Kit"" title=""Pump Out Vacuum Tool Kit"" width=""216"" height=""143"" align=""right"" style=""margin: 0 0 0 10px;"">A 19-inch squeegee tool and 3-piece recovery wand greatly improve your water pick up efficiency for large areas with this auto discharge wet vac.  The 10' hose gives the user a decent amount of coverage without having to move the base unit. If you do need to move the wet vacuum, it is on wheels, so it will easily roll around to wherever you need it to go. Motor insulation is in strict accordance with CSA and CENELEC regulations, and the heads feature anti-flame material.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

Most of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000115.htm"">trailer mounted power washers</a> are very industrialized units that are quite expensive, but offer tons of features. Cam Spray listened to their customers who said they needed a smaller, more portable, trailer pressure washer. This is model they developed for those customers. It is great for construction job sites, and even in manufacturing facilities.<br><br>&#13;
Cam Spray equipped this trailer mounted rig with a 6.5 horsepower Honda pressure washer that supplies 2500 PSI at 3 gallons per minute. The removable water tank holds 50 gallons of water which can be dispensed with the 100' hose and 2 piece wand. It is utility type cart, which is designed to be pushed by hand, and is not meant to be towed on public roads. The trailer can be outfitted with a hitch to be towed behind a golf cart, ATV, or utility vehicle.<br><br>&#13;
This portable trailer pressure may not be a road ready unit like our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/p001116.htm"">Honda trailer mount power washer</a>, but it still holds it own on the jobsite and in manufacturing settings.<br><br><strong><font color=""#0000FF""><u>Features:</u></font></strong><br>&#13;

IPC Eagle has built this cylindrical power scrubber on the premise that it utilizes a limited moisture system. No need to go back and forth to dump and refill your mop bucket. It will deep clean with only a fraction of the cleaning solution of traditional methods. The recovery system works on centrifical force from the brushes to recovery the scrubbed solution. Without any vacuum motors, it does a good job of recovery that solution. The soiled fluid tank easily snaps out with just one hand and can be dumped into any sink for quick disposal. With the limited moisture delivery system, you put down less solution, saving you money on chemical costs, and it allows your floors to dry much faster.<br><br><table width=""100%"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"">

Products HyraPort 100 is indeed a heated &#13;
automotive detailer that only has a single power &#13;
cord. We know it's hard to believe, but they were &#13;
able to pack this much power into a single power &#13;
cord! This machine was specifically designed for &#13;
the auto detailing, carpet cleaning, and &#13;
upholstery cleaning industries. It is a multi-&#13;
purpose machine that can be utilized to clean a &#13;
variety of different surfaces. The 12.5 gallon &#13;
solution and 11 gallon recovery tanks offer plenty &#13;
of room to detail multiple cars, or several pieces &#13;
of furniture. The single powerful 3-stage vacuum &#13;
motor, and the low moisture pressure system, which &#13;
dispenses at .8 GPM, allow for the quickest dry &#13;
times on the market. To improve dry times even &#13;
more, take a look at adding a <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000076.htm&#13;%0A"">carpet dryer</a> to your cleaning arsenal.<br><br><table width=""550"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" class=""verdanaLinks"" align=""center"">

automotive detailer because of its single power &#13;

often happens when cleaning cars, extremely easy. &#13;
To maximize its detailing capabilities, we &#13;

This heated cleaning package may take a little bit longer for delivery than the rest of our <a href=""http://www.cleanfreak.com/Qstore/c000134.htm"">carpet cleaning packages</a>, because we actually have the extractor wired to allow you to plug the powerhead into the extractor instead of the wall. This solves the problem of too many power cords. The heated extractor already has two power cords, one for the heater, and for the general use of the machine. So, when you add another cord, you now have 3 cords running the machine and attachments, so it can get quite hectic. That's why this package is so nice! Besides the powerhead, we also include all the attachments you could possibly need, along with an air mover for drying large areas of carpeting once they've been cleaned.<br><br><hr size=""1"">
